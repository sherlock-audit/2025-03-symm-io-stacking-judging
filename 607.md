# precision loss in  _addRewardsForToken

### Summary



The _addRewardsForToken function calculates the new reward rate as follows:

1. **Expired Period Case:**

   ```solidity
   if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
       state.rate = amount / state.duration;
   }
   ```

   **Example:**  
   With a default duration of 604,800 seconds (1 week), if a reward amount of 604,799 tokens is notified, then:
   
   - **Expected mathematically:** 604,799 / 604,800 ≈ 0.9999983…  
   - **Integer math in Solidity:** 604,799 / 604,800 = 0

   This means the computed reward rate is zero—even though nearly one token per second was expected—and stakers would not receive any rewards.

2. **Ongoing Period Case:**

   ```solidity
   else {
       uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
       uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
   }
   ```

   If the contract starts with a zero rate (because a small reward previously yielded 0) or if a tiny additional reward is added relative to a long duration, the division again truncates. For example, if no reward was effectively set (rate = 0) and a new reward amount below the duration is notified, the new rate remains zero.




### Root Cause

The _addRewardsForToken function calculates the new reward rate as follows:

1. **Expired Period Case:**

   ```solidity
   if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
       state.rate = amount / state.duration;
   }
   ```

### Impact


### Impact

- **Zero or Insufficient Reward Rate:**  
  If the reward amount is less than or equal to (duration – 1), the computed rate will be zero. As a consequence, stakers will accrue no rewards during that period.

- **Misaligned Expectations:**  
  A funder might expect a proportional reward accrual even for small amounts. However, because of integer division, even nearly full token amounts (e.g. 604,799 tokens for a week) yield a rate of zero, meaning no rewards are distributed.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Incorporate a precision multiplier (for example, multiply the numerator by 1e18) during rate calculation and adjust subsequent reward computations accordingly. This will ensure that even small reward notifications produce a nonzero rate and that the accrued rewards match the intended distribution.
