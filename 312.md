# SymmStaking::rewardPerToken can be updated every block to rounded down rewards

### Summary

There are factors that can cause `perTokenStored` to **fail in accurately tracking the rewards distributed per token to users**, such as approximately 2-second block intervals on the base network, as well as attackers attempting to make calls on every block.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200-L201

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```

We can see that ` (lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated)` would have a value of approximately 2 (block interval), and a multiplication with the rate and 1e18 (token decimals) may not be sufficient. An attacker could round the result down to 0, disrupting the reward tracking, **denying users to accumulate rewards**


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The worst case would be if `(blockInterval) * rate * 1e18 / totalSupply equals 0`, but even if it's not zero, rewards will still be reduced.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deposits and withdraws a minimal amount of staked tokens every block.

### Impact

* Users unable to accumulate rewards properly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increase precision in `rewardPerToken` and perform conversion when distributing rewards.
