# Incomplete handling of Deflationary or Fee-On-Transfer Tokens

### Summary

The staking and vesting contracts assume that token transfers occur on a 1:1 basis. If a deflationary token (one that deducts a fee on transfer) is used, the actual received amount may be lower than expected, leading to mismatches between the contract’s internal accounting and its actual token balance.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol), when users deposit the staking token, the contract uses `safeTransferFrom` for the exact amount and then credits that full amount to the user’s balance state​. If the staking token (or reward token in `notifyRewardAmount`) charges a fee or burns a portion, the contract will end up crediting more than it actually received. This mismatch can lead to insolvency: the contract’s `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` would be higher than the actual token balance held. A user withdrawing their full credited amount would then fail or revert due to insufficient actual tokens. Similarly, the vesting contract’s accounting doesn’t adjust for deflationary behavior. It reduces `totalVested` and user balances assuming 1:1 transfers. If a vested token were deflationary, claiming could result in less token leaving the contract than expected, potentially leaving residual `totalVested` that no longer matches reality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The token used for staking or vesting has a built-in transfer fee or burns a portion of the amount on transfer.
2. The contract credits the user based on the intended transfer amount, not the actual received amount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The token contract behaves in a deflationary manner (e.g., USDT or another fee-on-transfer token).
2. No external code adjusts for the fee on transfer.

### Attack Path

Suppose SYMM token or a future reward token is upgraded to have a 2% transfer fee. An attacker (or any user) deposits 100 SYMM into the staking contract. Due to the fee, the contract actually receives 98 tokens, but it still credits the user with 100 staked​. Now the contract’s internal `totalSupply` is 100 while holding only 98 SYMM. If the user (or others) attempt to withdraw these 100, the `safeTransfer` call will attempt to send 100 but the contract only has 98, causing a revert and trapping funds. In vesting, a similar scenario could occur if a vested token had transfer fees: the contract might think it paid out the full amount while some portion was burned, leading to accounting discrepancies.

### Impact

Users may lose access to a small percentage (e.g., 2%) of their tokens, or face withdrawal failures, resulting in an effective loss of funds or liquidity. The attacker does not gain directly but causes operational issues.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Disallow or handle deflationary tokens. The staking contract should verify the actual received amount on deposit (e.g., compare pre- and post-transfer balances) and adjust the credited amount accordingly. Alternatively, state in documentation that only non-deflationary ERC-20 tokens are supported. For the vesting contract, likewise restrict vesting to fixed-supply or mintable tokens (like SYMM and its LP) and not tokens with transfer fees or rebasing mechanics. If supporting such tokens, use balance checks around transfers and adjust vesting records to actual outcomes.
