# Reward period is extended each time a new reward is notified

## Summary
Extension of reward period each time a new reward is notified will cause the reward rate to be diluted for stakers.

## Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, the `_addRewardsForToken()` function will calculate the new reward rate for a reward token based on the amount of reward token added. After looping through every reward token, it then updates state.periodFinish by taking the current timestamp and adding state.duration.

## Vulnerability Details

If rewards are added before the currently stored periodFinish, it is likely that a reward period can never end. Period can be extended with minimal reward amounts added, and each extension will dilute the reward rate further. Calculation of rewards will hence become unpredictable. 

If a period never ends and admin calls `notifyRewardAmount()`, the else statement will always execute in `_addRewardsForToken()`, whereby the reward rate is calculated as such:
```solidity
                         uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

There is no definitive `periodFinish` as long as admin calls `notifyRewardAmount()` before the stored `periodFinish`.

`_addRewardsForToken()`:

## Impact
If a reward period never ends, the reward rate calculation will be diluted, and stakers will get less than they actually should. This is because total rewards are divided over a larger denominator (duration of the reward period), resulting in smaller reward rate.

## Mitigation
Do not extend the reward period after every reward notified.
