# Deleting and adding back reward token will break reward calculation

### Summary

When we delete token from rewards token we don't clean rewardState[deletedToken].lastUpdated field
SymmStaking.sol
```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
////

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
///
	}
```
This lead to dangerous situation in case this token will added back because when we calculate reward it assumed we have to pay it depends on the difference between current timestamp and the one stored at rewardState[deletedToken].lastUpdated

Since there is no any distribution between deleting and adding back token - users will unfairly receive big share of reward for the period between current time stamp and timestamp before deleting. It might instantly drain whole reward pot for this token 

### Root Cause

SymmStaking.sol
```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

token should be deleted and then added back

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Will happens itself
users farm some reward for token A
token A was deleted after distribution
token A was then added
Because we didn't reset the field, system "thinks" all the time passed since deletion to distribution should be awarded, which is obviously wrong

### Impact

reward system breaking, user will instantly receive big portion of reward

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

reset rewardState[deletedToken].lastUpdated field while adding back deleted token
