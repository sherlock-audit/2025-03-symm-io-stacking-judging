# Front-running vulnerability in initialization functions allows unauthorized control over core protocol contracts

## Description:
The core contracts of the Symmio protocol (`SymmStaking` and `SymmVesting`) implement the upgradeable proxy pattern using OpenZeppelin's `initializer` modifier. However, these contracts lack access control mechanisms on their initialization functions, making them vulnerable to front-running attacks.
For example, in `SymmStaking`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L153
```solidity
function initialize(address admin, address _stakingToken) external initializer {
    __AccessControlEnumerable_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    __Pausable_init();

    if (admin == address(0) || _stakingToken == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    stakingToken = _stakingToken;

    _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
    _grantRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, admin);
    _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, admin);
    _grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, admin);
}
```
Similar vulnerability exist in and `SymmVesting`. In all cases, the functions are protected against multiple initializations by the initializer modifier, but there is no restriction on who can call these functions first.

Since there is no factory contract or secure deployment mechanism to ensure that initialization happens in the same transaction as deployment, an attacker could monitor the mempool for proxy deployments and front-run the legitimate initialization transaction with their own, setting themselves as the admin and gaining complete control over the contracts.

## Impact:
If an attacker successfully front-runs the initialization of any core protocol contract, they would gain full administrative control over that contract, allowing them to:
- For `SymmStaking`: Control reward distribution, pause/unpause the contract, rescue tokens, and potentially steal staked funds
- For `SymmVesting` (and `Vesting` since `Vesting::__vesting_init()` is called inside `SymmVesting::initialize`): Modify vesting plans, change penalty parameters, pause the contract indefinitely, and potentially steal user tokens

This represents a critical risk as it could lead to the complete compromise of user funds and protocol functionality. The vulnerability affects all deployment scenarios since there is no protected mechanism for deployment and initialization.

## Recommended Mitigation:
Implement a factory pattern that ensures proxy deployment and initialization occur within a single, atomic transaction:
