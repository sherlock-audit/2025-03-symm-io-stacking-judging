# Stakers may not be able to claim all their reward

### Summary

Per the Audit ReadMe, USDC will be used in the contracts

Rewards claiming is done in a loop for all possible rewards tokens that a user is entitled to and this can prevent a user from claiming some of their rewards.

### Root Cause

The problem is that the reward tokens are sent to a user in a loop for all the tokens which the user has accrued rewards for and as such if a user's account has been blacklisted by one of the reward tokens then the `_claimRewardsFor()` function will revert

```solidity
File: token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol
265: 	function claimRewards() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
266: 		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);
267: 	@>	_claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);
268: 	}


385: 	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
386: 		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
387: 		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
388: 			address token = rewardTokens[i];
389: 			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
390: 			if (reward > 0) {
391: 				rewards[user][token] = 0;
392: 				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
393: 	@>			IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
394: 				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
395: 			}
396: 			unchecked {
397: 				++i;
398: 			}
399: 		}
400: 	}

```

This can lead to loss of rewards for the claiming user

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

One of the reward token blacklists staker's address

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

Total loss of rewards for staker

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider sending the reward token in a `try/catch` block
