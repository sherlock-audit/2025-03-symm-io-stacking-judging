# notifyRewadAmount is halted preventing reward accrual

## Summary

The issue arises from the use of the `whenNotPaused` modifier on the `notifyRewardAmount` function in the contract. The `whenNotPaused` modifier prevents certain functions from executing when the contract is paused. Specifically:

- The `deposit` function correctly uses `whenNotPaused`, ensuring that new deposits are not accepted when the contract is paused.
- However, the `notifyRewardAmount` function, which is responsible for notifying the system about new reward tokens, also uses `whenNotPaused`.

This creates a conflict because if the vault is paused (preventing new deposits or stakes), any attempts to add rewards via `notifyRewardAmount` are also halted. This prevents the accrual of rewards, even though the vault may still accumulate new rewards for existing users or handle rewards associated with external mechanisms.

This is problematic because even though deposits are halted, the vault still needs to continue receiving rewards, updating its reward distribution, and making reward claims. The pause mechanism effectively blocks reward accumulation, halting the flow of rewards into the vault and stopping accrual of rewards for users.

### Root Cause

Using `whenNotPaused` modifier on `notifyRewardAmount` function.

## Internal pre-conditions

1. there are users have staked in the vault
2. admin pause the contract halting any further deposit or withdraw

## External pre-conditions

- `notifyRewardAmount` is called addin rewards for stakers

### Impact

- `notifyRewardAmount` function is broken not functioning correctly (broken core contract functionality) 
- Rewards won't accumulate for vault stakers

### Attack Path

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

1. **Vault is Paused**:

	- The protocol admin decides to pause the vault, preventing users from making new deposits or stakes.

2. **`notifyRewardAmount` Function Call**:

	- External systems call the `notifyRewardAmount` function to add new rewards to the vault.
	- However, since the contract is paused (due to the `whenNotPaused` modifier), the `notifyRewardAmount` function cannot execute, and the rewards are not added.

3. **Consequences**:

   - Users who are still staked in the contract or have existing balances will not accrue rewards because the reward rate is not updated and new rewards cannot be added to vault.

4. **Reward Accumulation Stops**:

   - Even though users are still holding stakes and should be receiving rewards, those rewards are not being distributed or accumulated because the vault is paused and `notifyRewardAmount` cannot be called.

### Mitigation

To address this issue and allow reward accumulation to continue even when the vault is paused, you should **remove the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the `notifyRewardAmount` function**. The idea is that while the contract may be paused to prevent new deposits or stakes, reward notifications should still be processed to ensure ongoing reward accumulation. The contract should allow rewards to be added to the system regardless of the pause state.

- **Modify the `notifyRewardAmount` function** to allow reward notifications even if the contract is paused:

```diff
--  function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
++  function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant {
```
