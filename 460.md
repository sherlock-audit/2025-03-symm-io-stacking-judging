# 'notifyRewardAmount' can be used to grief users

### Summary

`notifyRewardAmount` is used to announce new rewards and reset the rewardAccrual using a fixed duration. Typically, in staking protocols this function implements access control as calling it often with small(dust) rewards amounts can be used as a griefing attack to increase the distribution duration indefinitely.

### Root Cause

[notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) does not have any access control. By supplying a dust amount, users will be able to increase the duration of previous rewards, due to using a fixed duration.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:
1.The protocol has allocated 100e18 of rewards to be distributed in 10 days = 10e18/day 
1.After one day a user calls notifyRewardAmount passing 1wei. now the reward speed will be 9e18/day and users will have to wait another day.
By calling this funciton often with dust amounts the protocol will suffer extreme griefing potentially postponing the reward forever.

### Impact

Users will be unable to claim their reward - High

### Mitigation

The notifyRewardAmount should be restricted
