# The rewards distribution system in SymmStaking can be diluted by extending the state.periodFinish

## Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount()` in SymmStaking extends the reward amount and `state.periodFinish`, alos calculates based on initail duration. Since this function is invoked by anyone, the `state.periodFinish` can be extended at any time and as result the rewards distribution system will be diluted.

## Root Cause

In the [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L289) :: `notifyRewardAmount()` function, it invokes [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) :: `_addRewardsForToken()` function to add amount of reward.

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
	@>		_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

In the `_addRewardsForToken()` function, it adds amount of reward token and extends `state.periodFinish` by initial duration from current block.timestamp. Also, it calculates new `state.rate` with initial duration.

Attacker can dilute rewards distribution by invoking this function iteraly. Let's consider following scenario.

- Total rewards to be distributed is 1000 usdc and duration is 1 weeks. `state.rate = 1000e6 / 604800 = 1653`.
- After 1 day, attacker invokes `notifyRewardAmount()` with 0.000001 usdc and this updates `state.rate = (1000e6 / 604800 * 518400 + 1) / 604800 = 1416`.
- After 2 days, attacker invokes `notifyRewardAmount()` with 0.000001 usdc and this updates `state.rate = (1416 * 432000 + 1) / 604800 = 1011`.
- ...

By this way, attacker can dilute the rewards distribution and stakers will receive less rewards than normal.

## Impact
The stakers will receive less rewards than normal.

## Mitigation

1. Implement access restriction to `notifyRewardAmount()` function.

2. Add minAmount check for the `_addRewardsForToken` to make attacker costs much.

```diff
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

+       require(amount >= minAmount);
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
