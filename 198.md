# An attacker will temporarily block all staking operations for users through cheap L2 DOS attacks

### Summary

The lack of array length limits in `notifyRewardAmount` will cause a denial of service for all staking operations as an attacker can repeatedly call the function with large arrays on Base L2's cheap gas, making core contract functions unusable.

### Root Cause

In In [SymmStaking.sol:notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) there is no limit on the array size for `tokens` and `amounts` parameters, and the function is publicly callable. This is particularly problematic on Base L2 where gas costs are minimal. there is no limit on the array size for `tokens` and `amounts` parameters, and the function is publicly callable. This is particularly problematic on Base L2 where gas costs are minimal.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be unpaused
2. At least one reward token needs to be whitelisted
3. `rewardTokens.length` needs to be greater than 0

### External Pre-conditions

1. Base L2 gas prices need to remain low (typical ~$0.01-0.05 per transaction)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates large arrays of whitelisted token addresses and amounts
2. Attacker repeatedly calls `notifyRewardAmount` with these arrays
3. Each call forces the contract to:
   - Loop through large arrays
   - Execute `_updateRewardsStates` for each token
   - Process multiple token transfers
4. Due to Base L2's low gas costs, attacker can sustain this attack cheaply
5. This blocks legitimate users from:
   - Depositing tokens (`deposit` function)
   - Withdrawing stakes (`withdraw` function)
   - Claiming rewards (`claimRewards` function)

### Impact

The protocol suffers temporary denial of service. The attacker loses gas fees (minimal on Base L2) and gains nothing (griefing attack). Users cannot interact with core staking functions during the attack period.

### PoC

```solidity
describe("DOS Attacks", function() {
		let mockToken: ERC20;

		beforeEach(async function() {
			// Deploy mock token
			const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20");
			mockToken = await ERC20.connect(admin).deploy("MOCK", "MOCK");
			await mockToken.waitForDeployment();
			
			// Configure it as reward token
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await mockToken.getAddress(), true);
		});

		it("should revert with large arrays due to gas limits", async function() {
			const tokenCount = 5000;
			const tokens: string[] = [];
			const amounts: string[] = [];
			
			for(let i = 0; i < tokenCount; i++) {
				tokens.push(await mockToken.getAddress());
				amounts.push(ethers.parseEther("1").toString());
			}

			await mockToken.connect(admin).approve(
				await symmStaking.getAddress(),
				ethers.parseEther(tokenCount.toString())
			);

			await expect(
				symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount(tokens, amounts)
			).to.be.reverted;
		});
	});
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
// Add constant for maximum array length
uint256 constant MAX_TOKENS_PER_NOTIFY = 10;

function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external 
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)  // Add role restriction
{
    require(tokens.length <= MAX_TOKENS_PER_NOTIFY, "Too many tokens");
    // ... rest of function
}
```
The mitigation adds both a maximum array length limit and restricts the function to trusted addresses with the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE.
