# Frontrunning Attack Through Premature Token Approvals

### Summary

Incorrect approval mechanism in `_addLiquidity` ([Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L99)) will cause a potential loss of funds for users as malicious actors can frontrun the approval and steal tokens due to the approval being set before checking token balances.

### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting.sol:144-145`, the contract approves PERMIT2 for both SYMM and USDC tokens before verifying the actual token balances or performing safety checks:
```solidity
usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `addLiquidity()` or `addLiquidityByPercentage()` with any amount
2. Contract needs to have SYMM tokens available for vesting
3. User needs to have sufficient USDC balance

### External Pre-conditions

None required - the vulnerability exists independently of external protocol states.

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `addLiquidity()` with parameters (amount=1000, minLpAmount=100, maxUsdcIn=500)
2. Before the transaction is mined, Attacker B frontruns with:
   - Observes the pending transaction
   - Calls PERMIT2's transferFrom() to drain either SYMM or USDC using the approval
3. User A's transaction gets mined but fails due to insufficient balance
4. Attacker has successfully stolen the tokens

### Impact

The affected party (user) suffers a loss of either their SYMM or USDC tokens up to the approved amount. The attacker gains these tokens with only the cost of gas fees for the frontrunning transaction.

### PoC

```solidity
function testFrontrunningAttack() public {
    // Setup
    address attacker = address(0x1);
    address victim = address(0x2);
    uint256 amount = 1000e18;
    
    // Victim approves and calls addLiquidity
    vm.prank(victim);
    symmVesting.addLiquidity(amount, 100e18, 500e18);
    
    // Attacker frontruns and steals tokens
    vm.prank(attacker);
    IERC20(USDC).transferFrom(address(symmVesting), attacker, amount);
    
    // Assert tokens were stolen
    assertEq(IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(attacker), amount);
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Move the approvals after all safety checks are performed
2. Implement a check-approve-interact pattern
3. Consider using Permit signatures instead of approvals
4. Add a reentrancy guard specifically around the approval and interaction section

Example fix:
```solidity
function _addLiquidity(...) internal returns (...) {
    // Pull USDC first
    usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
    
    // Verify balances
    require(symm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= symmIn, "Insufficient SYMM");
    require(usdc.balanceOf(address(this)) >= usdcIn, "Insufficient USDC");
    
    // Now do approvals
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0); // Reset approval
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0); // Reset approval
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
    
    // Continue with liquidity addition
    ...
}
```
