# Incorrect Approval Target in `_addLiquidity()`, Should Approve VAULT Instead of Router

### Summary

The `SymmVesting_addLiquidity()` function incorrectly approves the router instead of the VAULT to spend tokens, leading to potential failures in liquidity operations.  


### Root Cause

```solidity
		// Pull USDC from the user and approve the VAULT.
		usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
		usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
		symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
		PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
		PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```

In the `_addLiquidity()` function, the implementation approves the router to spend the tokens instead of the VAULT. According to the intended logic, the VAULT should be the entity authorized to spend the tokens, ensuring proper execution of liquidity operations. However, the code incorrectly sets the approval target to the router, which may cause liquidity addition to fail or require redundant approvals.  


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Potential transaction failures of liquidity addition since the approval should granted to  VAULTâ€™s contract.

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
		// Pull USDC from the user and approve the VAULT.
		usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
		usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
		symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
		PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(VAULT), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
		PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(VAULT), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
