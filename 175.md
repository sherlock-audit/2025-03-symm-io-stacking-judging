# Missing Permit2 Nonce Management will lead to token theft through front-running

### Summary



The lack of proper nonce management in Permit2 approvals will cause a loss of funds for users using the liquidity addition feature as attackers can front-run their transactions and drain tokens from the contract.





### Root Cause

In [SymmVesting.sol:187-189](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L187C3-L189C1) the Permit2 approvals don't include nonces and use block.timestamp as the deadline:

```solidity
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have a vesting plan with locked SYMM tokens
2. The user needs to call `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityByPercentage` to convert some of their locked SYMM to LP tokens
3. The SymmVesting contract must have sufficient SYMM balance to handle the operation


### External Pre-conditions

1. A Balancer pool with SYMM and USDC tokens must exist and be active
2. The Permit2 contract must be functioning correctly

### Attack Path

1. User submits transaction to call `addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn)`
2. Attacker front-runs this transaction and monitors the mempool
3. Attacker executes a transaction that calls the same function but forces it to fail after the Permit2 approvals have been made (e.g., by causing a revert in the router call)
4. Now the approvals for both SYMM and USDC are valid but unused, with block.timestamp as the deadline
5. Attacker immediately submits another transaction that exploits these approvals to transfer tokens from the contract to themselves
6. When the user's original transaction executes, it will either fail due to insufficient balances or execute with reduced amounts


### Impact

The SymmVesting contract suffers a loss of SYMM and USDC tokens intended for liquidity addition. The attacker gains these tokens, potentially draining significant value from the contract and causing users to lose their vested assets. Since the approval amounts can be up to the full vesting position sizes, the potential loss could be the entire vested amount for affected users.

### Mitigation

1. Use proper nonce management with Permit2 by tracking and incrementing nonces for each approval:

```solidity
// Track nonces per token
mapping(address => uint256) private tokenNonces;

function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Use tracked nonces for each token
    uint256 symmNonce = tokenNonces[SYMM]++;
    uint256 usdcNonce = tokenNonces[USDC]++;
    
    PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp + 300), symmNonce);
    PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp + 300), usdcNonce);
    
    // ...remaining code...
}
```

2. Alternatively, implement a safer approval pattern by using standard ERC20 approvals with exact amounts and revoking unused approvals after the operation completes:

```solidity
symm.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), symmIn);
usdc.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), usdcIn);

try ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(...) returns (uint256[] memory _amountsIn) {
    amountsIn = _amountsIn;
    // Additional logic
} finally {
    // Revoke any remaining approvals
    symm.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), 0);
    usdc.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), 0);
}
```
