# Edge Case Allowing Theft of Funds via Manipulated Liquidity Addition

## Summary

A malicious actor can exploit an edge case in the liquidity addition process of the `SymmVesting` contract to manipulate the pool's price, minimize the required USDC deposit, and extract profits from the protocol. This attack exploits the lack of robust protections against price manipulation during liquidity provision, potentially leading to theft of funds or unfair advantages.

---

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol assumes that liquidity providers will add SYMM and USDC at fair market prices based on the pool's reserves. However, due to the deterministic pricing formula of the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM), an attacker can manipulate the pool's price before and after a victim's liquidity addition. This manipulation allows the attacker to profit while leaving the victim with an inefficient trade.

### Proof of Concept: Sandwich Attack

To demonstrate this vulnerability, let’s walk through a concrete example with adjusted numbers to highlight the attacker's profit potential.

---

### Initial Pool State

- Reserves:
  - $ \text{SYMM} = 10,000 $
  - $ \text{USDC} = 1,000 $
- Price:
  $$
  \text{Price of SYMM} = \frac{\text{USDC Reserve}}{\text{SYMM Reserve}} = \frac{1,000}{10,000} = 0.1 \, \text{USDC per SYMM}
  $$

The victim wants to add liquidity using **5,000 SYMM**.

---

### Step 1: Attacker's Front-Run

The attacker observes the victim’s pending liquidity addition and submits a large swap to manipulate the pool’s price. They swap **3,000 SYMM for USDC**, significantly decreasing the price of SYMM in terms of USDC.

1. **USDC received by attacker**:
   $$
   \text{USDC Out} = \frac{\text{SYMM In} \cdot \text{USDC Reserve}}{\text{SYMM Reserve} + \text{SYMM In}}
   $$
   Substituting values:
   $$
   \text{USDC Out} = \frac{3,000 \cdot 1,000}{10,000 + 3,000} = \frac{3,000,000}{13,000} \approx 230.77 \, \text{USDC}
   $$

2. **New pool reserves**:
   - $ \text{SYMM} = 10,000 + 3,000 = 13,000 $
   - $ \text{USDC} = 1,000 - 230.77 = 769.23 $

3. **New price of SYMM**:
   $$
   \text{Price of SYMM} = \frac{\text{USDC Reserve}}{\text{SYMM Reserve}} = \frac{769.23}{13,000} \approx 0.0592 \, \text{USDC per SYMM}
   $$

Notice that the price of SYMM has decreased significantly due to the attacker's front-run trade.

---

### Step 2: Victim Adds Liquidity

The victim adds liquidity at the manipulated price. To match the new ratio ($ 1 \, \text{SYMM} = 0.0592 \, \text{USDC} $), the victim deposits:
- $ 5,000 \, \text{SYMM} $
- Corresponding USDC:
  $$
  \text{USDC Required} = \frac{\text{SYMM Amount} \cdot \text{USDC Reserve}}{\text{SYMM Reserve}}
  $$
  Substituting values:
  $$
  \text{USDC Required} = \frac{5,000 \cdot 769.23}{13,000} \approx 295.85 \, \text{USDC}
  $$

#### Victim's Liquidity Addition

1. **New pool reserves**:
   - $ \text{SYMM} = 13,000 + 5,000 = 18,000 $
   - $ \text{USDC} = 769.23 + 295.85 = 1,065.08 $

2. **New price of SYMM**:
   $$
   \text{Price of SYMM} = \frac{\text{USDC Reserve}}{\text{SYMM Reserve}} = \frac{1,065.08}{18,000} \approx 0.0592 \, \text{USDC per SYMM}
   $$

Notice that the victim deposited fewer **USDC** than they would have at the true market price.

---

### Step 3: Attacker's Back-Run

The attacker swaps their **230.77 USDC** back for SYMM, profiting from the price difference caused by the victim's trade.

1. **SYMM received by attacker**:
   $$
   \text{SYMM Out} = \frac{\text{USDC In} \cdot \text{SYMM Reserve}}{\text{USDC Reserve} + \text{USDC In}}
   $$
   Substituting values:
   $$
   \text{SYMM Out} = \frac{230.77 \cdot 18,000}{1,065.08 + 230.77} = \frac{4,153,860}{1,295.85} \approx 3,205.49 \, \text{SYMM}
   $$

2. **Profit**:
   - Initial SYMM spent: $ 3,000 $
   - Final SYMM received: $ 3,205.49 $
   - Profit:
     $$
     \text{Profit} = 3,205.49 - 3,000 = 205.49 \, \text{SYMM}
     $$

## Impact

This attack exploits the following vulnerabilities in the current implementation:

1. **Lack of Robust Slippage Protection**:
   - The `maxUsdcIn` parameter does not fully protect against significant price manipulations.
2. **Reliance on Instantaneous Pool Prices**:
   - The `getLiquidityQuote` function uses the pool's instantaneous price, which is susceptible to manipulation.


The impact includes:

1. **Financial Loss for Victims**:
   - Victims adding liquidity suffer inefficiencies due to the manipulated price, receiving fewer LP tokens than expected.
   - This results in reduced returns for liquidity providers.
2. **Profit for Attackers**:
   - Attackers can repeatedly execute sandwich attacks to extract profits from the protocol, draining value from honest users.

Manual Review

## Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following measures should be implemented:

1. **Implement Slippage Protection**:
   - Enforce strict slippage limits (`minLpAmount` and `maxUsdcIn`) to reject trades with excessive price impact and should be calculated outside of the addLiquidity context.
2. **Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)**:
   - Replace instantaneous prices with a TWAP oracle to smooth out short-term manipulations and provide fairer pricing.
