# User can't claim any reward tokens when his address gets blacklisted in `USDC` contract

### Summary

The protocol implemented the claiming reward mechanism in a way that it claims all rewards for a user in a single function call, looping through all of the reward tokens and sending them to the user. The issue with this approach is that the user can get blacklisted in `USDC` contract. As a result the user will not be able to claim any other tokens earned in the `SymmStaking` contract.


### Root Cause

`_claimRewardsFor` loops through all of the reward tokens and sends them to claimer in one function call.

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `USDC` token must be whitelisted in `rewardTokens` array (it will be as from the `README` page the `USDC` will be whitelisted token)
2. User has to earn rewards in `USDC` and other tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. User must get blacklisited in `USDC` contract after he earned rewards

### Attack Path

There is no attack because it is normal functionality that is disrupted by wrong function implementation.

### Impact

User who gets blacklisted in `USDC` contract can't claim other tokens. If user couldn't claim only `USDC` rewards there would be no issue. However, the `USDC` blacklist prevents user from claiming other tokens which leads to loss of funds as user should be able to claim rewards in other tokens.

### PoC

`_claimRewardsFor` does the `safeTransfer` call to user which results in revert in csae that user is blacklisted in `USDC` contract.

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Mitigation

Allow user to claim the reward tokens in seperate function calls. This resolves the `USDC` blacklist issue.
