# User is blocked from providing liquidity in case he has more then half of his tokens unlocked

### Summary

Users can avoid withdraw penalties by providing there vested symm tokens as liquidity on balancer.
The users can decide the amount they want to provide.

In case a user first provides half of there tokens to balancer and later tries to deposit the other half, the transaction will revert due to an incorrect check in _resetVestingPlans. 

### Root Cause

In _resetVestingPlans() the transaction will revert in case the new amount is less the already unlocked amount.

This means that in case:
A user has 50% of his tokens already unlocked, and wants to provide liquidity with the rest, the transaction will revert. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user initially provides liquidity with 50% or more of his tokens
2. After unlocking this amount, he wants to provide liquidity with the rest of tokens

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

User is blocked from intend functionality, providing liquidity.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
