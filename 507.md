# USDC Rewards Will Not Accrue Due to Precision Loss in `rewardPerToken` Calculation

### Summary

The use of a fixed multiplier of `1e18` in the `rewardPerToken` calculation on a 6-decimal token like USDC will cause a precision loss, resulting in zero incremental rewards for stakers. This happens as the admin funds the contract with USDC rewards daily, but the reward calculation rounds the small incremental value down to 0.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194C1-L202C3

In `SymmStaking.sol` in the `rewardPerToken` function, the calculation:
  ```solidity
  rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
      (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply);
```
uses a fixed multiplier of `1e18`. For USDC (which has 6 decimals), this causes the computed incremental reward to be too small and to round down to 0 when divided by a high `totalSupply`. This means that any calculation involving USDC rewards effectively multiplies by 1e18 but then gets divided by `totalSupply`, leading to a precision loss.
If the total reward amount and the `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate` are small, the per-token reward increment becomes so small that it rounds down to zero when stored as an integer. This rounding issue prevents stakers from accumulating USDC rewards over time, even though the reward pool is being funded.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reward token USDC is included in the `rewardState` mapping.
2. The `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate` is small, as USDC has 6 decimals and is distributed in small amounts.
3. The time difference between reward updates (`lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated`) is short (e.g., 2 seconds), making the computed reward increment even smaller.
4. `totalSupply` of staked tokens is high, further reducing the per-token reward calculation and leading to rounding down to zero.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` to fund USDC rewards in the contract.
2. Stakers expect to earn USDC rewards over time but observe that their `earned()` balance does not increase.
3. The issue persists regardless of how many times the admin funds the contract, as the computed reward increments remain negligible due to rounding.

### Attack Path

1. **Admin Action:** The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` to fund the contract with USDC rewards.
2. **State Update:** The contract updates its reward state via `_updateRewardsStates`, calling `rewardPerToken`.
3. **Precision Loss:** The per-token USDC reward increment rounds down to zero due to the fixed `1e18` multiplier and the low `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate`.
4. **User Impact:** Stakers attempt to claim USDC rewards but receive nothing, as their `earned()` value remains at zero.

### Impact

Stakers will not receive any USDC rewards despite the contract being funded. This results in a complete loss of expected yield for users relying on USDC rewards.

### PoC


- `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate = 0.005 * 1e6` (0.005 USDC per second, scaled to 6 decimals)
- `totalSupply = 500_000 * 1e18` (500,000 tokens staked, normalized to 18 decimals)
- `lastUpdated` is 5 seconds ago.

Using the formula from `rewardPerToken`:
```solidity
rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
    (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply);
```
Substituting values, you will get 0.05. Since `rewardPerToken` stores values as integers, `0.05` rounds down to `0`, meaning:
- `rewardPerToken` does not increase.
- `earned()` remains at zero.
- No USDC rewards accrue to stakers.

### Mitigation

1. Adjust the `rewardPerToken` formula to normalize reward tokens to 18 decimals before applying the 1e18 multiplier.
2. Alternatively, implement a dynamic scaling factor that adjusts based on the tokenâ€™s decimals to prevent precision loss.
