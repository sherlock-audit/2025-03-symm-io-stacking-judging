# `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` Default Slippage Setting Too Restrictive

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L177

The hardcoded 1% default slippage in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` will cause frequent transaction failures for users attempting to add liquidity during periods of normal market volatility. Since most users interact through UIs that rely on default parameters without customizing slippage settings, this affects a good portion of transactions. Price movements routinely exceed 1% between submission and execution, especially in lower liquidity pools like SYMM, resulting in widespread failed transactions.

### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` , the default slippage calculation `(expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100` enforces a strict 1% maximum price movement if no  `minLpAmount` is set in the parameter, which is extremely tight and insufficient for volatile cryptocurrency markets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user does not specify a custom `minLpAmount` parameter, causing the function to use the default 1% slippage calculation

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market volatility for `SYMM` pair exceeds 1% within the timeframe between transaction submission and execution
2. Network congestion causes delays in transaction processing, increasing the likelihood of price movements exceeding the slippage tolerance of 1%

### Attack Path

1. User calls a function that internally calls `_addLiquidity` without specifying a custom `minLpAmount`
2. The function calculates `minLpAmountWithSlippage` as `(expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100`, setting a 1% slippage tolerance
3. Due to normal market volatility, the actual LP amount received is less than the calculated minimum
4. The transaction reverts with `SlippageExceeded` error
5. The transaction fails the user must retry the transaction with higher slippage tolerance or wait for more favorable market conditions

### Impact

The users of the protocol suffer frequent transaction failures during state of volatile market operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the default slippage calculation to use a more reasonable value like 2%.
