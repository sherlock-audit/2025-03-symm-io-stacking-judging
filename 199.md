# Malicious actor can disrupt the reward distribution mechanics using trivial amounts

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks access control, 
meaning anyone can call it (not just admins). 
This allows a malicious actor to manipulate critical reward parameters 
(like state.rate, state.periodFinish) for whitelisted tokens.

1. Disrupting the contract's reward distribution mechanics and  
2. Blocking Reward token removal 

An attacker can forcefully reset `state.periodFinish `
to `block.timestamp` + duration by calling `notifyRewardAmount ` with a trivial amount. 

The new `state.rate ` is calculated as 
`(leftover + amount) / duration` 
allowing attackers to skew rewards even with negligible `amount`.

This extends the reward period indefinitely, 
and diluting rewards over time, 
even blocking the removal of the reward token.

### Root Cause

`SymmStaking.sol `

Different root causes based on design choice as follows,

1. Lack of access control in  `notifyRewardAmount` function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L291

2. Lack of sufficient validation for the reward `amounts ` parameter allows dust amounts  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Internal Pre-conditions

The attack happens because 
1. `notifyRewardAmount` function does not have access control
2.  Insufficient validation of newly added reward `amounts `in  `notifyRewardAmount` function

the current implementation of  `notifyRewardAmount ` only checks 
`if (amount == 0)` 
which does not restrict dust amounts ( like 1wei ).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker should possess at least trivial amounts of whitelisted reward tokens

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Attack Path


### 1. Attack Scenario : Reward Rate Dilution 

_1.1 Initial Setup (January 1)_

Token USDY is whitelisted with DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1 week.

Admin notifies 1000 USDY to be distributed over 1 week:

state.rate = 1000 / 604,800 ≈ 0.00165 USDY /sec.

state.periodFinish = [Current Time] + 1 week = January 8


_1.2 First Attack (January 4):_

After 3 days (259,200 seconds), 
the attacker calls 
`notifyRewardAmount(USDY, 1 wei).
`
Remaining Time: 4 days (345,600 seconds).

Leftover Rewards:
345,600 sec * 0.00165 USDY /sec ≈ 570.24 USDY.

New Rate: (43% reduction)
(570.24 + 1 wei ) / 604,800 ≈ 0.000942 USDY/sec.  

New Period Finish: (January 4) + 1 week = (January 11)

_Reward rate went from initial 0.00165 USDY /sec to 0.000942 USDY/sec , a 43% reduction._ 

The attack can be performed repeatedly, as the cost of attack is negligible.
Each subsequent attack decreases the rate even further,
extending the impact.


### 2. Attack Scenario :  block the removal of a reward token

A malicious actor can even block the removal of a reward token from whitelist thru frontrunning 

2.1 `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`  attempts to removing a token thru `configureRewardToken` function
`configureRewardToken(usdy , false)`


2.2  An attacker frontruns and  calls `notifyRewardAmount` with same token to increment `pendingRewards`, 
making it impossible to remove the token.

`notifyRewardAmount(USDY, 50 wei).
`

This happens due to the following check in `configureRewardToken` function 
`pendingRewards[token] > 10` 

that reverts the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`'s call to remove the token from whitelist. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Impact

**Impact : HIGH**

1. Legitimate users earn significantly fewer rewards for the intended duration
due to the manipulated reward rate.

2. _Extended Duration_
The attacker forces the reward period to reset to a full week each time, 
stretching the distribution of leftover rewards over increasingly longer periods.

3. Repeated attacks can render the staking system unusable, 
as rewards become negligible.

4. Blocking Reward token removal 

5. _Reputation Damage:_ 
Users lose trust in the platform if they perceive it as insecure or unfair.



**Likelihood : HIGH**

1. _Low Barrier to Entry:_ 
The attack requires minimal technical skill and cost (only 1 wei per call).

2. Attackers can disrupt the system for fun, profit, or competitive advantage.

3. _Repeatable:_ 
The attack can be performed repeatedly, compounding its impact.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mitigation

Few potential options to fix this, depending on design choice

**1. Add Access Control**
Only allow REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE to call  `notifyRewardAmount ` 

`function notifyRewardAmount(...) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)
`

**2. Validate Reward Amounts : Increase cost of attack**

Reject trivial amounts  
`require(amount > MIN_REWARD)   
// where the MIN_REWARD could be a certain percentage of remaining rewards
`

**3. Use Fixed Reward Periods**

  Do not reset `state.periodFinish` when new rewards are added. 
  Instead, allow rewards to queue or use a fixed schedule.

**4. Revert if the new rate is significantly lower than the previous rate**
