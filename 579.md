# Token Lockup Through Vesting Plan Reduction

### Summary

The [`_resetVestingPlans`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L234) function in the Vesting contract has a vulnerability where tokens can become permanently trapped in the contract when a vesting plan is reset to a lower amount. While the accounting is correctly updated to track the new lower amount, the "freed" tokens physically remain in the contract with no mechanism to retrieve them, effectively resulting in lost funds that can't be recovered.


### Root Cause

When resetting a vesting plan to a lower amount, the function updates internal accounting but does not transfer the difference in tokens out of the contract:
```javascript
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    // ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        // ...
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        // No token transfer for the difference (oldTotal - amount) when amount < oldTotal
        // ...
    }
}
```
While the contract's internal accounting is updated (via` totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount`), there is no corresponding token transfer to remove the excess tokens from the contract's balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin wants to reset vesting for a user by decreasing the amount

### External Pre-conditions

//Nada

### Attack Path

1. The Vesting contract is set up with vesting plans for multiple users:

- User A has 100,000 tokens vesting over 1 year
- The contract physically holds these 100,000 tokens
- totalVested[token] equals 100,000


2. Due to a change in tokenomics or other business requirements, an admin decides to reduce User A's vesting allocation to 80,000 tokens:

- Admin calls resetVestingPlans(token, [userA], [80000])
- This executes _resetVestingPlans internally


4. The function execution:

- Gets the current locked amount: oldTotal = 100,000
- Resets the vesting plan to the new amount: vestingPlan.resetAmount(80000)
- Updates accounting: totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - 100000 + 80000 = totalVested[token] - 20000
- This correctly reduces the accounting records by 20,000 tokens


5. However, the physical token balance remains unchanged:

- The contract still holds all 100,000 tokens
- 20,000 tokens are now "orphaned" - not accounted for in any vesting plan
- There is no function to withdraw these excess tokens


6. The tokens are permanently trapped in the contract:

- The contract has no function to withdraw unallocated tokens
- The tokens remain in the contract's balance but are not tracked in totalVested
- This creates a discrepancy between physical tokens and accounted tokens

### Impact

Financial Loss: Any tokens freed by reducing vesting plans are permanently locked in the contract, representing a direct financial loss equal to the total of all vesting reductions performed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a token withdrawal mechanism for excess tokens
