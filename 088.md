# Deflationary Token Fee Misalignment Leading to Inaccurate Accounting

In the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234-L243) function, the contract directly increases the user’s staked balance and overall `totalSupply` by the `amount` parameter provided, as illustrated in the snippet below:

```solidity
IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
totalSupply += amount;
balanceOf[receiver] += amount;
```

If the staking token is deflationary or charges transfer fees, the actual amount received by the contract may be less than the declared `amount`. The contract, however, does not verify the actual balance change before updating state variables, resulting in an over-crediting of user balances and an inflated `totalSupply`. This discrepancy between the actual token balance held by the contract and the accounting state may allow users to withdraw more tokens than were truly received, leading to a misalignment in reward calculations and potentially causing a loss of funds.

#### Root Cause
The deposit function fails to account for token transfer fees or deflationary behavior, as it solely relies on the user-specified `amount` without verifying the actual token balance change.

#### Impact
 Users might end up withdrawing more tokens than are available in the contract, leading to fund depletion and undermining the integrity of the staking pool.

#### Mitigation
Validate the actual token balance change during deposits by comparing the contract’s balance before and after the transfer, and adjust the credited amount accordingly.
