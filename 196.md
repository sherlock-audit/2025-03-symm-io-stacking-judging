# Users can claim Vested tokens even before a vesting schedule starts

## Summary: 

If a Vesting plan *startTime* is set to occur at a future date from current time, then it can be changed by anyone to current time via `_claimLockedToken()`. 
So users will be able to claim the vested tokens even before such schedule starts. 

## Description: 

In contract `Vesting`, vesting plans can only be set by a trusted role via `setupVestingPlans()`. 
We can decide when the vesting should start/end by giving a start and end date. 

Users can claim their unlocked tokens via `claimUnlockedToken()` depending on the period that has elapsed from `startTime`.
However, if the `startTime` for a vesting schedule is set to a future date, then it's **NOT** possible to claim these tokens before the schedule starts. 

However, there is a way around this, due to this issue, a user will be able to change the startTime for a vesting schedule to current timestamp 

[#_claimLockedToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L293)
A user can call function `_claimLockedToken()` using dust amount for a vesting plan which is supposed to start on a future date. 
This function further calls `resetAmount()` in `LibVestingPlan` in order to reset the vesting plan. 

```solidity 
// Adjust the vesting plan
 vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
```

[#resetAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71-L82)
```Solidity
	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {

	.............
	
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self); // Look Here 
		
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
		self.startTime = block.timestamp; // Look here
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
		self.amount = amount; 
		
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}

function remainingDuration(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {

return self.endTime > block.timestamp ? self.endTime - block.timestamp : 0;
    }
```

Notice that, when computing `remaining duration`, we don't check whether the current `block.timestamp` is LOWER than `self.startTime` or not. 
Due to this, it returns the total difference from current time to endTime(including startTime).
Here, we also update the `startTime` to current timestamp. 

There is a penalty levied on whoever tries to claim locked tokens. 
However, if we are trying to claim just 1 wei of  `amount` as there is no minimum limit, then there would be literally no penalty on this, and we will be able to set the future vesting date to current date. 

If suppose a vesting schedule is supposed to start 30 days from now, and it's duration is 10 days, then, a user through this function, can unlock vested tokens of about: 
`30 days/40(30+10) * 100 = 75%` would be unlocked and available for claiming even before the vesting schedule starts for other users. 



## Recommendation: 

Consider adding a require check in `resetAmount()` which ensures that it cannot be called before vesting schedule starts.
