# improper Use of `initializer` Modifier in Symmetric Vesting Contract.


### Summary:
The Symmetric Vesting Contract (`SymmVesting`) uses the `initializer` modifier for its `initialize` function, but the parent contract `Vesting` has the `__vesting_init` function marked as `initializer`. This can result in issues, as the `initializer` function of the parent contract (`Vesting`) may not be called correctly due to the lack of the `onlyInitializing` modifier in the parent contract. This can cause unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities if the initialization sequence is not properly handled.

### Root Cause:
- **Missing `onlyInitializing` Modifier**: The parent contract `Vesting` does not use the `onlyInitializing` modifier in its `__vesting_init` function. The `initializer` modifier can only be called once per contract, and parent contract initializers need to be protected with the `onlyInitializing` modifier to ensure proper sequencing when using inheritance.
- **Incorrect Initialization Sequence**: The lack of proper parent contract initialization (with `onlyInitializing`) can prevent the `Vesting` contractâ€™s initialization logic from being executed correctly, leading to incomplete contract setup. This can also cause the child contract (`SymmVesting`) to miss vital setup steps.

### Impact:
- **Incomplete Contract Setup**: Without proper initialization of the parent contract (`Vesting`), critical state variables and roles may not be set correctly, leading to an incomplete contract setup. This can cause the contract to function incorrectly or unexpectedly.

### Mitigation:
1. **Add `onlyInitializing` Modifier in Parent Contract**: Ensure the parent contract (`Vesting`) uses the `onlyInitializing` modifier for the `__vesting_init` function to guarantee that initialization logic is only executed once during contract deployment.
   ```solidity
   function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public onlyInitializing initializer {
       // Initialization logic here
   }
   ```
