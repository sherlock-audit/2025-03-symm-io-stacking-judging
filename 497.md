# `Vesting.sol` use `initializer` modifier instead of `onlyInitializing`

### Summary

`Vesting.sol` use `initializer` modifier instead of `onlyInitializing`. 

This is incorrect for a contract like `Vesting.sol`, which is meant to be inherited by `SymmVesting.sol`. 

In this inheritance model, the contract `SymmVesting.sol` also has its own initialize function, which includes the initializer modifier and calls the initialize function of `Vesting.sol`. The problem here is that both the parent contract `Vesting.sol` and the child contracts `SymmVesting.sol` are using the initializer modifier, which limits initialization to only one call.

According to the [OpenZeppelin documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer--), the [onlyInitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-onlyInitializing--) modifier should be used to allow initialization in both the parent and child contracts. The  [onlyInitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-onlyInitializing--) modifier ensures that when the initialize function is called, any contracts in its inheritance chain can still complete their own initialization.

> A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once. In its scope, onlyInitializing functions can be used to initialize parent contracts.

### Root Cause

*In [Vesting.sol:76](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76) use `initializer` modifier instead of `onlyInitializing`*

### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

The vulnerability causes a significant operational issue, preventing inheriting contracts from completing initialization. This could lead to a failure in the deployment of critical protocol components, affecting the overall system functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace `initializer` with `onlyInitializing` on `Vesting.sol`

```solidity
function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public onlyInitializing
```
