# `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity()` default slippage protection does not actually provide any slippage protection

### Summary

`SymmVesting::_addLiquidity()` [defines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L177) a default slippage protection of `1%`:
```solidity
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
```
However, there is actually no slippage protection, as the default calculation is performed after the price is already manipulated in the pool and the balances are already skewed. Thus, the protocol expects users to still have 1% protection but they don't have at all.

### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting:171`, the default slippage protection does not work.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `SymmVesting::addLiquidity()`, setting `minLpAmount` to 0 to expect slippage protection of 1%, but it is not really enforced.

### Impact

User is vulnerable to any amount of slippage, which exceeds 1%.

### PoC

Consider the following pool state when the user computes the transaction off chain:
SYMM = 50000, USDC = 1000, Supply = 1000

User expects to send 100 USDC and 5000 SYMM to get 100 LP tokens.
User specifies `maxUsdcIn` of 100 USDC and 5000 SYMM from the vested position.

Pool is manipuled in the meantime (imbalanced), becoming something like:
SYMM = 100000, USDC = 500, Supply = 1000

Now, in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity()`, the balances above are fetched, and the user is expected to get `5000 / 100000 * 1000 = 50` lp tokens.
Slippage is `1%`, so the user should get at least `50 * 99 / 100 = 49.5`.
As the balances are already factored in, the user should get very close to 50 lps (minus dust).
Assuming the correct price of SYMM is 0.02 USDC, the user deposited 5000 SYMM = 100 USDC + `50*500/1000 = 25 USDC` = 125 USDC

Thus, the user deposited into an imbalanced pool, and the checks didn't protect the user, so the liquidity the user deposited is going to be arbitraged away and the user will take major losses.
Due to arbitrage, as the pool afterwards comes back to the initial balanced state of
SYMM = 50000, USDC = 1000, Supply = 1000
The user will get `50/1000*50000  = 2500 SYMM = 50 USDC` + `50/1000*1000 = 50 USDC, totalling 100 USDC only. So the user lost 25 USD or `25/125 = 20%` of their initial deposit.

### Mitigation

Never set default slippage.
