# Adding rewards during an active period will cause reduced per-second rewards for stakers as the protocol resets the distribution timeline

### Summary

Root Cause: In SymmStaking.sol, the _addRewardsForToken function resets the reward duration to DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION (1 week) when adding new rewards to an ongoing period.
Impact: Stakers receive diluted rewards as newly added rewards are spread over a full week instead of the remaining period duration.

### Root Cause

Code Issue: In [SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379), leftover rewards from an ongoing period are combined with new rewards and distributed over a new 1-week duration.

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to reset the duration when topping up rewards is a mistake, as it unfairly extends the distribution timeline and reduces per-second rewards.
```solidity
	    function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward period for a token (e.g., USDC) is ongoing (block.timestamp < periodFinish).

2. Admin/Reward Manager calls notifyRewardAmount to add more rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Initial Setup:

  Reward period for USDC ends in 3 days (remaining time = 259,200 seconds).
  Current reward rate: 100 USDC/week ≈ 0.00165 USDC/sec.

2. Admin Adds New Rewards:
  solidity
  notifyRewardAmount([USDC], [100e6]); // 100 USDC added  

3. Reward Recalculation:

  solidity
  uint256 leftover = 259,200 sec * 0.00165 USDC/sec ≈ 427.68 USDC;  
  newRate = (100e6 + 427.68e6) / 604,800 sec (1 week) ≈ 0.000873 USDC/sec  

4. Result: Reward rate drops from 0.00165 → 0.000873 USDC/sec despite increased total rewards.

### Impact

- Stakers suffer a 47% reduction in per-second rewards despite additional USDC being added.

- Protocol faces accusations of misleading reward distribution mechanics.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Distribute new rewards over the remaining duration instead of resetting to 1 week:

function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {  
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];  

    if (block.timestamp < state.periodFinish) {  
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;  
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;  
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining; // Use remaining time  
        state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + remaining;  
    } else {  
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;  
        state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;  
    }  
}  


This ensures new rewards are distributed over the original schedule’s remaining time.
