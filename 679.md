# Reward Manager will unwhitelist reward tokens incorrectly affecting the protocol and users

### Summary

The incorrect check on pendingRewards instead of the active reward period in the configureRewardToken function will cause disrupted reward distribution for users as the reward manager will unwhitelist tokens still in an active reward period, inadvertently removing them from the reward system.



### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, the configureRewardToken function contains a flawed condition:
The check if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]); only evaluates whether pendingRewards[token] exceeds 10.
```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
@>			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

It fails to verify if the reward period is still active (i.e., block.timestamp < rewardState[token].periodFinish), allowing unwhitelisting of tokens even during an ongoing reward period if pendingRewards[token] <= 10.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward Manager needs to call configureRewardToken to set the tokenâ€™s whitelist status to false.

2. The reward token must have pendingRewards[token] set to at most 10, allowing the unwhitelisting to bypass the flawed check, even if the reward period remains active.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Reward Manager calls configureRewardToken(token, false) to unwhitelist a reward token.

2. The contract checks pendingRewards[token] > 10. If pendingRewards[token] <= 10, the function proceeds, ignoring whether the reward period is still active.

3. The token is removed from the rewardTokens array and its whitelist status is set to false, halting reward distribution for that token despite an ongoing reward period.



### Impact

- Users cannot claim rewards for the affected token if its reward period was still active, as the token is no longer recognized as valid.

- The protocol suffers disrupted reward distribution, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies and reduced user trust.
Severity: Medium
This vulnerability enables the reward manager to unwhitelist a token during an active reward period, but only when pendingRewards[token] <= 10. It does not result in direct fund loss, but it disrupts the reward system, impacting user experience and protocol reliability. The conditional nature of the exploit limits its severity compared to high-impact vulnerabilities.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract SymmStaking {
    mapping(address => bool) public isRewardToken;
    mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRewards;
    mapping(address => TokenRewardState) public rewardState;

    struct TokenRewardState {
        uint256 periodFinish;
    }

    function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external {
        if (!status) {
            if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert("OngoingRewardPeriodForToken");
            delete isRewardToken[token];
        }
    }
}

contract IncorrectUnwhitelistTest is Test {
    SymmStaking public staking;
    address public rewardToken = address(0xABC);
    address public rewardManager = address(0x123);

    function setUp() public {
        staking = new SymmStaking();
        staking.isRewardToken[rewardToken] = true;
        staking.rewardState[rewardToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        staking.pendingRewards[rewardToken] = 5; // pendingRewards <= 10
    }

    function testIncorrectUnwhitelist() public {
        vm.startPrank(rewardManager);
        staking.configureRewardToken(rewardToken, false);
        assertFalse(staking.isRewardToken[rewardToken]);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, modify the configureRewardToken function to check the reward period explicitly:

```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external {
    if (!status) {
        if (block.timestamp < rewardState[token].periodFinish || pendingRewards[token] > 0) {
            revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
        }
        delete isRewardToken[token];
    }
}
```
This ensures unwhitelisting is blocked if the reward period is active or if any pending rewards remain, preserving the integrity of the reward distribution system.
