# Missing Access Control in notifyRewardAmount() Function Allows Reward Period Manipulation

### Summary


**Missing Access Control in `notifyRewardAmount`** will cause **Indefinite Reward Period Extensions** for **Stakers** as **Any User** will **Add Minimal Rewards to Reset the Reward Cycle**.  



### Root Cause

In [`notifyRewardAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L293), the absence of role-based access control allows **any user** to call the function. This enables attackers to exploit the reward rate calculation logic in `_addRewardsForToken()`, extending the `periodFinish` indefinitely with trivial token amounts (e.g., 1 wei).  



### Internal Pre-conditions

At least one reward token must be whitelisted (isRewardToken[token] == true)
The attacker needs to possess a minimal amount (as little as 1 wei) of a whitelisted reward token


### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Admin configures TokenA with `rate = 1000 tokens/week` and `duration = 1 week` (`periodFinish = block.timestamp + 1 week`).  
2. Attacker waits until **1 block remains** in the reward period (`block.timestamp ≈ periodFinish - 1`).  
3. Calls `notifyRewardAmount(TokenA, 1 wei)`, transferring 1 wei of TokenA to the contract.  

- `pendingRewards[TokenA]` increases by **1 wei**.  
- In `_addRewardsForToken()`:  

```solidity  
    uint256 remaining = 1; // 1 block remaining  
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; // leftover = 1000 tokens  
    state.rate = (1 wei + 1000) / 1 week; // New rate ≈ 1000 tokens/week  
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + 1 week; // Period extended by 1 week  
```  
- Attacker repeats Step 2-3 each time `periodFinish` nears expiration, permanently locking the reward period.  




### Impact

Attackers can continuously extend reward periods by adding minimal amounts (1 wei) of tokens. The reward duration that should end naturally can be manipulated to continue indefinitely


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation



Restrict `notifyRewardAmount()` to authorized roles (e.g., `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`).
