# [M-05] Potential Accounting Issue in resetVestingPlans

## Summary

The `resetVestingPlans` function in Vesting.sol contains a potential accounting issue that could lead to incorrect token accounting and possible fund loss when resetting vesting plans.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Vesting.sol:220-238, the `_resetVestingPlans` function is implemented as follows:

Code reference: Vesting.sol#L220-L238 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L220-L238

```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        // Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
```

The issue lies in the accounting logic at line 232-234:

1. The function first claims any unlocked tokens for the user via `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)`.
2. It then checks if the new amount is less than what has already been unlocked: `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();`
3. However, after claiming unlocked tokens, `vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()` should be 0, making this check ineffective.
4. The function then calculates `oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount()` to adjust the `totalVested` accounting.
5. Finally, it updates the global accounting with `totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount`.

The problem is that after calling `_claimUnlockedToken`, the vesting plan's state has changed, but the accounting logic doesn't properly account for this change. The `oldTotal` variable captures only the locked amount, not the total amount before the reset, which can lead to incorrect accounting in the `totalVested` mapping.

Additionally, the `resetAmount` function (as seen in issue M-04) resets the vesting timeline, which can further complicate the accounting as it changes the vesting schedule.

## Impact

The impact of this issue includes:

1. **Incorrect Token Accounting**: The `totalVested` mapping may not accurately reflect the actual amount of tokens being vested, leading to discrepancies in the protocol's accounting.

2. **Potential Fund Loss**: If the accounting is incorrect, it could lead to situations where users are unable to claim their tokens or where the protocol incorrectly calculates available tokens.

3. **Protocol Insolvency Risk**: Over time, these accounting errors could accumulate, potentially leading to a situation where the protocol believes it has more or fewer tokens vested than it actually does.

4. **Administrative Burden**: Correcting these accounting errors would require manual intervention and potentially complex reconciliation processes.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Vesting.sol:220-238
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        // Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_resetVestingPlans` function to ensure accurate accounting by:

1. Capturing the total amount before any operations:

```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.amount; // Capture total amount before any operations
        
        // Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        
        // After claiming, check if the new amount is valid
        if (amount < vestingPlan.claimedAmount) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
        
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
```

2. Alternatively, consider redesigning the accounting logic to track vested amounts more accurately, possibly by maintaining separate counters for claimed and unclaimed tokens.
