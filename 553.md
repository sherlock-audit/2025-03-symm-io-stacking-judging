# Reward Distribution Extends Period Instead of Adjusting Rate

## Description
The `_addRewardsForToken` function is responsible for updating the reward rate and period when new rewards are added. However, when rewards are added mid-period, the function resets `periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + state.duration`, effectively extending the total reward period instead of distributing the rewards over the remaining time.

## Vulnerability Details
- If rewards are added before the current reward period ends, the function extends the period rather than adjusting the rate to fit within the remaining time.
- This could lead to unexpected reward distribution behavior, where rewards are stretched over a longer timeframe instead of increasing the reward rate within the current period.
- The expected behavior for adding rewards mid-period should be to recalculate the rate so that all rewards, including the new ones, are distributed over the remaining time instead of extending the period.

## Impact
- Users expecting higher immediate rewards may receive them over a longer period, potentially leading to lower short-term incentives.
- Could lead to inefficiencies in the reward system, particularly in time-sensitive protocols where reward distribution timing is crucial.

## Proof of Concept
1. Assume a token `TKN` has a reward duration of 7 days and `periodFinish` is set for the end of the current period.
2. A user adds additional rewards on day 3.
3. Instead of adjusting the reward rate to distribute the new rewards over the remaining 4 days, the contract extends `periodFinish` by 7 days, making the total period 10 days.
4. The new rewards are spread over a longer duration, which may not be the intended behavior.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Instead of resetting `periodFinish`, adjust the reward rate so that the new rewards are distributed within the remaining time.
- Modify the logic to only extend `periodFinish` when the function is called after the previous period has ended.
- Consider implementing a weighted reward adjustment mechanism that proportionally updates the rate without extending the period unnecessarily.
