# Balancer Pool Price Manipulation

## Summary
Attackers can manipulate `SYMM/USDC` pool balances to distort liquidity quotes, enabling LP reward extraction at others’ expense.

## Vulnerability Description
The `getLiquidityQuote` function uses real-time pool balances to calculate required `USDC` and expected LP tokens. By artificially inflating/deflating pool balances via large swaps, attackers can manipulate quotes to overstate LP token rewards.

```solidity
/// @notice Calculates the USDC required and LP tokens expected for a given SYMM amount.
	/// @dev Uses current pool balances and total supply to compute the liquidity parameters.
	/// @param symmAmount The amount of SYMM.
	/// @return usdcAmount The USDC required.
	/// @return lpAmount The LP tokens that will be minted.
	function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
	}
```

## Likelihood
Requires capital to manipulate pools but feasible with flash loans.

## Impact
Users overpay for liquidity or receive fewer LP tokens. Attackers extract excess rewards.

## Proof of Concept

1. Attacker swaps `1M USDC → SYMM`, inflating the pool balance of SYMM.
2. `getLiquidityQuote`() now requires less USDC for liquidity.
3. Attacker adds liquidity, receiving more LP tokens than fair.
4. Reverses initial swap to restore pool balances.

## Recommendations
Integrate Chainlink like Oracle services for quote calculations.
