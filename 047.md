# Incorrect Reward Rate Adjustment During Active Distribution Period lead to Unfair Distribution.

### Summary
When adding new rewards **(notifyRewardAmount)** during an active distribution period, leftover rewards are
 combined with new rewards and spread over the full default duration (1 week) instead of the remaining 
time. This dilutes rewards for stakers.

### Root Cause

During the rate calculation the **_addRewardsForToken()** function uses full duration, not remaining time.

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        ***state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; // Wrong: Uses full duration, not remaining time.
    }
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; // Extends by full duration.
}
```

###  Vulnerability Detail
The contract incorrectly calculates the reward rate when new rewards are added during an active distribution period. Instead of distributing the remaining rewards correctly over the actual remaining period, the function **_addRewardsForToken()** resets the period and distributes the total **(leftover + new rewards)** over a full default duration (7 days).

This leads to diluted rewards, causing users to receive significantly fewer rewards than expected. Attackers can exploit this miscalculation to manipulate reward distribution, resulting in an unfair advantage for themselves.


### Impact

- Legitimate stakers receive fewer rewards due to dilution.
- An attacker can manipulate the timing of adding rewards to continuously reset and dilute the rate.
### PoC:

**Step 1: Initial Setup**
    Assume the contract has a staking rewards pool with an ongoing reward distribution.
-     Remaining rewards: 100 USDC
-     Remaining time: 1 day
-     Current reward rate: 100 USDC/day
-     Default reward duration: 7 days

Step 2: Malicious Manipulation
-     Admin adds 200 USDC in the middle of the ongoing distribution

```solidity
stakingContract.notifyRewardAmount(200);
```
**The flawed reward rate calculation executes**
```solidity
uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp; // remaining = 1 day
uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;  // leftover = 100 USDC (1 * 100)
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;  // (100 + 200) / 7 = 42.85 USDC/day
```
**Impact on Rewards Distribution**
- Instead of getting 300 USDC in 1 day (remaining) + 7 days (new)
- The contract incorrectly distributes 42.85 USDC/day for 7 days
- Legitimate stakers receive far less than expected.

**Step 3: Attacker's Exploitation Strategy**

- The attacker can trigger **notifyRewardAmount()** multiple times to continuously reset and dilute rewards, effectively keeping the rate low.
- By monitoring transactions, the attacker can stake right after dilution, ensuring they get a disproportionate share.
- The attacker could distribute rewards across multiple addresses to manipulate the reward claim process.

### Recommendation

Instead of always dividing by the full default duration, adjust the reward calculation to consider the remaining time in the current reward cycle.

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / (remaining + state.duration);
```
