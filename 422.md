# bad actor can keep rewards per token at 0 by taking advantage of rounding down

### Summary

The function calculating rewards for distribution is $time elapsed * rate / staked$ because solidity rounds down and if

Rewards can be kept at 0 by calling updates every second so that `staked > time elapsed * rate ` 

### Root Cause

This vulnerability is caused rounding down when calculating [rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200-L201). 

```solidity
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /	totalSupply);
```
The core formula is:
$time elapsed * rate / staked$ 
If the `time elapsed` is 1 & $rate < staked$ we will get no rewards for that period. However even tho no rewards were received, the system will updated `lastUpdated` to the current timestamp.




### Internal Pre-conditions

For this exploit to happen we need to have `totalSupply > rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) `

### External Pre-conditions

no xternal needed

### Attack Path

For this exploit the attacker needs to spam the updates every second.

### Impact

Based on this the exploit can prevent accumulating rewards, this can be very effective on lower decimals reward tokens, such as usdc and wbtc.
Since no rewards may be accumulated, stakers may leave. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix this to mitigate:

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256, bool) { // <@
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return (rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored, true);
		}
			
			((( uint256 rewards = lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply);
bool update = rewards > 0 ? true : false // <@
return (rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored + rewards, update)
	}
```
Only update time if returned bool is true
