# An attacker can create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for reward token removal

### Summary

A missing lower bound check on the pendingRewards amount in configureRewardToken will allow an attacker to send a small amount (e.g., 10 wei) using notifyRewardAmount, which will prevent admins from removing the token from the reward whitelist.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, the function configureRewardToken reverts with OngoingRewardPeriodForToken if pendingRewards[token] > 10, allowing an attacker to block token removal by sending a minimal amount through notifyRewardAmount.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount() with a small amount (11 wei) for a whitelisted token.
The token has not been removed from the whitelist.
The admin attempts to remove the token using configureRewardToken().

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount([token], [11]), adding 11 wei to pendingRewards[token].
The admin attempts to remove token from the whitelist using configureRewardToken(token, false).
The function reverts due to the OngoingRewardPeriodForToken check (pendingRewards[token] > 10).
The token remains whitelisted indefinitely, preventing its removal.

### Impact

Admins are unable to remove a token from the whitelist, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in reward management.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the threshold check in configureRewardToken to require a more significant pending reward amount before blocking token removal
