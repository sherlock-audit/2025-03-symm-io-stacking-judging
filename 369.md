# Reward Rate Manipulation in SymmStaking Contract

### Summary


A vulnerability exists in the reward rate calculation mechanism of the SymmStaking contract. An attacker can manipulate the reward rate by calling the `notifyRewardAmount` function with a negligible reward amount (e.g., 1 wei) during an ongoing reward period. This action recalculates the reward rate to a drastically lower value, resulting in a significant reduction in the rewards accrued by stakers.


### Root Cause

- **Reward Rate Calculation Flaw:**  
  The function `_addRewardsForToken` recalculates the reward rate with the formula:  
  `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;`  
  Here, `leftover` is computed as the product of the remaining time and the previous rate. Under normal circumstances, this allows for smooth updates of the reward rate when additional rewards are notified but with lower amount + leftover we divide to duration again.

- **Insufficient Validation Checks:**  
  There is no check preventing a notifiy of an extremely small amount during an active reward period. If a malicious actor submits a `notifyRewardAmount` call with, say, 1 wei, the new calculation incorporates this minuscule value along with the leftover, which may dramatically lower the computed rate.

- **Manipulation During Ongoing Period:**  
  Since the rate is updated regardless of the reward amount's significance, a low-value call can override a previously established higher rate (e.g., from 165 to 1). This unexpected change affects the calculation in subsequent reward accruals, leading to substantial losses for stakers.

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

### Attack Path

1. A user stakes 100e18 SYMM tokens, and under normal conditions, a reward notification for 100e6 USDC is processed with a reward rate of approximately 165 (100e6 / 604800).

2. A malicious actor calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a reward amount of 1 wei during the same reward period. This call is processed in the same block.

3. The function `_addRewardsForToken` is invoked, where:
   - The remaining time is nearly the full period (e.g., 604800 seconds).
   - The calculation uses the minimal reward (1 wei) plus the computed leftover is again divide by the duration.
   - As a result, the new `state.rate` becomes drastically lower (approximately 1 instead of 165).

4. Subsequent reward calculations, such as in `rewardPerToken()` and `earned()`, use the manipulated rate. This leads to significantly lower rewards for stakers—for example, reducing a user's reward from the expected ~99 USDC to a much lower amount, thereby causing a loss of reward tokens.


### Impact

If a malicious user calls the notifyRewardAmount function with 1 wei in the same block, the calculation in _addRewardsForToken becomes:

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

Assuming:
- remaining time ≈ 604800 seconds,
- leftover = 1 wei × 604800,

Then:

```solidity
state.rate = (1 + 604800) / 604800 ≈ 1
```

This reduces the state.rate from 165 to approximately 1, which directly causes a loss of reward tokens for the user. With this lower rate, both the rewardPerToken() and earned() calculations yield significantly lower rewards than intended.

### PoC

If a user stakes 100e18 SYMM tokens and 100e6 USDC in rewards are notified for one week (i.e., the finish period in the earn function), then the math works out as follows:

- **Rate Calculation:**  
  100e6 / 604800 = 165

- **Calculation in rewardPerToken():**  
  (604800 * 165 * 1e18) / 100e18 = 997920

- **Calculation in earned():**  
  (100e18 * 997920) / 1e18 = 99792000  
  So, the user receives approximately 99 USDC.

The problem arises if a malicious user calls the `notifyRewardAmount` function—which internally calls `_addRewardsForToken`—with 1 wei. If the admin notification occurs in the same block, then the calculation in `_addRewardsForToken` is:

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

Assuming:
- `uint256 remaining = 604800` (or one less, for example, 604799)
- `leftover = 1 * 604800`
  
Then:

```solidity
state.rate = (1 + 604800) / 604800 ≈ 1
```

Thus, the state.rate changes from 165 to 1, causing the user to lose reward tokens. Now, the calculations become:

- **New rewardPerToken():**  
  (604800 * 1 * 1e18) / 100e18 = 6048

- **New earned():**  
  (100e18 * 6048) / 1e18 = 604800

This means the user receives 604800 instead of 99792000, resulting in a loss of reward tokens.

### Mitigation


Ensure that only authorized entities (e.g., those with the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`) can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function, and consider adding further checks to prevent manipulation during an active reward period.
