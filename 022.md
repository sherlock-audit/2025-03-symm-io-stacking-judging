# Precision loss will cause users to lose rewards in rewardPerToken calculation

### Summary

The division before multiplication in rewardPerToken calculation will cause significant precision loss for stakers as the reward distribution will be truncated to zero for small amounts.

### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:rewardPerToken` (lines 194-202) 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202' the reward calculation performs division before multiplication, causing precision loss: `(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply)`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Total supply needs to be greater than zero.
2. rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate needs to be set to a small value.
3. Time difference (lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated) needs to be relatively small.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions required.


### Attack Path

  1. User stakes a small amount of tokens when totalSupply is large
  2. Due to division before multiplication, the calculation `(time_diff * rate * 1e18) / totalSupply` truncates to 0
  3. Even though rewards should accumulate, the perTokenStored value doesn't increase
  4. This continues until the numerator becomes large enough to overcome the division truncation

### Impact

 The stakers suffer an approximate loss of rewards proportional to truncation frequency. Specifically:
  - Small stakers lose rewards completely when rate * time_diff < totalSupply/1e18
  - Medium stakers receive fewer rewards than entitled
  - The lost rewards remain stuck in the contract

          // Calculate reward with current implementation
          uint256 badReward = (timeDiff * rate * 1e18) / totalSupply;
          
          // Calculate reward with corrected order
          uint256 goodReward = (timeDiff * 1e18 * rate) / totalSupply;
          
          // Verify precision loss
          assertEq(badReward, 0, "Bad implementation truncates to zero");
          assertGt(goodReward, 0, "Correct implementation preserves precision");
      }
  }
  ```

### Mitigation

 1. Reorder the mathematical operations to perform multiplication before division:
     ```solidity
     return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored + 
         (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * 1e18)
         * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate) / totalSupply;
     ```
  2. Consider using a higher precision factor than 1e18 for intermediate calculations
  3. Add minimum rate checks to prevent extremely small reward rates
  4. Consider implementing reward accumulation checkpoints to minimize precision loss over time
