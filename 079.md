# Users earns no rewards when the first notifyRewardAmount value is less than 604800.

### Summary

All users earn 0 rewards when the system first pendingTokens is less than 604800. No matter how many reward tokens are set thereafter. (if the amount equal or greater than is not set, the rewards will always 0(zero)) 

### Root Cause

The internal _addRewardsForToken() which updates the reward token rate, is called when the notifyRewardAmount() is called, the _addRewardsForToken() logic works with the reward token duration value (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370). 

but the issue is that the amount sent is less than the state.duration value (DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION - 604800), so it will always round up the reward token value to 0. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls notifyRewardAmount() with a values less than 604800 (lets say 604700)

### External Pre-conditions

No external conditions

### Attack Path

1. User calls notifyRewardAmount() with a values less than 604800 (lets say 604700)
2. if a user deposits and tries to withdraw after 200s, there is no reward.

### Impact

This makes all users lose rewards no matter their deposits, no matter how many rewards tokens are notified thereafter by the admin (except the value is equal or more than 604800).

### PoC

   `
       
        it("should show how rewards are lost based on the first notifyRewardAmount value", async function () {
			// Scenario: Single depositor â€” user1 deposits 604,600 SYMM, waits 200s, to claim 200 tokens.

			const depositAmount = "604600"
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), "604700")
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], ["604700"])

			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), "10000")
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], ["10000"])

			await time.increase(200)

			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)


			await time.increase(200)

			const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

			expect(claimed).to.equal(0n)

		})

`

Add the above code to symmStaking.behavior.ts file (under describe("Reward Calculation", () => {}). When you run the test, u will see the test passed. Showing that user ended up with 0(zero) rewards after 200s

### Mitigation

1. The team should have a check in notifyRewardAmount(), to make sure that the first notify amount sent is equal or above (604800 - the value for DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION)
