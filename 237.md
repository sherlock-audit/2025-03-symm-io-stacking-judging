# Excess SYMM Tokens Not Returned in _addLiquidityProcess

### Summary

In the **SymmVesting::_addLiquidityProcess()** function, excess SYMM tokens remain locked after liquidity is added. The function resets the vesting plan's locked amount but does not return the unused SYMM tokens to the user. This results in token loss and accounting inconsistencies.

### Root Cause

The function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L142
resets the symmVestingPlan with the difference between the locked amount and the amounIn[0]
which is incorrect, the function should reset the symmVestingPlan with the new amountIn[0] calculated in the function _addLiquidity() 
and refund the excess of the SYMM token to the user same as we did the usdcIn in the _addLiquidity() 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L206

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user has SYMM tokens locked in the vesting plan.

- The function _addLiquidityProcess is executed.

### External Pre-conditions

- The caller provides an amount greater than what is actually needed for liquidity.

- The vesting plan is already set up with locked SYMM tokens.

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates _addLiquidityProcess 

2. The function deducts the necessary amount for liquidity (amountsIn[0]).

3. The remaining SYMM tokens (symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]) are not returned.

4. The excess tokens remain locked in the vesting plan, leading to unintended loss.

### Impact

- Users lose access to a portion of their SYMM tokens.

- The total vested amount in SymmVesting.sol is not correctly updated.

### PoC

1. A user locks 1,000 SYMM tokens in vesting.

2. Calls _addLiquidityProcess(1_000, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn).
3.  the symmLockedAmount is calculated to be 900

4. The function only uses 800 SYMM for liquidity (amountsIn[0] = 800).
5. the symmVestingPlan  will be reset with 100 token
             symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]) ==> symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(900 - 800 );
the remaining 200 ( initial 1000 - 800 )  token will be locked instead of returned to the user.
6. wrong calculation of reset amount which should be 800 the amounIn[0].



### Mitigation

Modify _addLiquidityProcess to return excess SYMM tokens to the user and reset with the correct amount of tokens

```solidity
symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(amountsIn[0]);
if (amount- amountsIn[0] > 0) symm.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount- amountsIn[0]);
```
