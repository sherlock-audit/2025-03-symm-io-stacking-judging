# Token Emission Loss Due to Division of Reward Amount in `_addRewardsForToken` Function.


### Summary:
The `_addRewardsForToken` function is responsible for calculating the reward rate for a given token based on the total reward amount and duration. However, there is a significant issue where the division of the reward amount by the duration can lead to loss of tokens, as the division operation might not account for the remainder of the reward. This issue causes the contract to emit fewer tokens than expected, which could affect the reward distribution. Instead of directly dividing the amount by the duration, it should account for any remainder by using the leftover tokens from the previous calculation, ensuring that no tokens are lost during the process.

### Root Cause:
- **Token Loss Due to Integer Division**: The division of the reward amount by the duration (`amount / state.duration`) causes truncation of any remainder due to Solidity's behavior of integer division. This leads to a loss of tokens because any fractional tokens from the division are discarded.
  
  For instance, if the reward amount is not perfectly divisible by the duration, the remainder (or residue) is lost and not considered for future calculations. This results in fewer tokens being emitted than what was originally intended.
  
  - **Example**: If 10,000,000  USDC  tokens are being distributed over a 1-week duration (604800 seconds), and the division doesn't consider the remainder, the fractional tokens are lost. The division should consider any leftover amount and carry it over to the next reward period.
  
10,000,000 /604800 = 16.5343915344 tokens per second, 
result in Actual emission =  16 tokens * 604,800 seconds = 9,676,800 tokens.(which is less than actual Transferred)

### Impact:
- **Loss of Tokens**: Tokens that should be distributed as part of the rewards are lost due to truncation in the division operation. Over time, this could result in a significant reduction in the total rewards distributed.
- **Incorrect Reward Distribution**: The rewards are calculated at a lower rate, causing users to receive fewer tokens than expected, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and confusion.


### Attack Path:
-

### Mitigation:
1. **Handle Residuals Properly**: To prevent the loss of tokens, the residual from the previous reward period should be carried over and added to the current reward amount. This ensures that no tokens are lost during the division process.
   
   - **Example Solution**: Before recalculating the rate, take into account the remainder (residual) from the previous period, and include it in the new reward calculation. You can store this residual in a separate variable and adjust the reward rate accordingly:
   ```solidity
   uint256 rewardResidual = rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardResidual;
   uint256 reward = amount + rewardResidual;
   rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardResidual = reward % state.duration;
   reward = reward - rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardResidual;
   state.rate = reward / state.duration;
   ```

2. **Avoid Loss Due to Division**: Ensure that the reward calculation doesn't lose tokens by incorporating any leftover tokens as residuals. This can be done by adjusting the reward rate based on the leftover tokens, as shown above.
