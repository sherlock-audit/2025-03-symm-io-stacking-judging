# The `claimLockedTokenByPercentage` function will be mostly useless and prone to user abusing it due to rounding.

### Summary

In the `Vesting.sol` contract the [claimLockedTokenByPercentage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L167) function can be used by a user or an admin if he wants to claim his locked tokens by percentage. The function takes two params- the `token address` and a `percentage param` i.e `uint256`. This percentage param [according to the natspec of the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L166) is - `Percentage of locked tokens to claim (between 0 and 1 -- 1 for 100%).` As can be seen that `1` will and should be used if the user wants to claim the 100% of his lockedToken.

The issue here is that this is vulnerable and will produce rounding issues. The function calls the internal `_claimLockedToken` and params that are passed in this functions are the token address, msg.sender and the returned value from the [getLockedAmountsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L309) function ```multiplied by the percentage param / 1e18```. This can result in many use cases that hte user can use this issue to abuse in his favor. 

See the impact and the attack path for that.

### Root Cause

Incorrect calculation of the tokens to claim and pass in as params in the [claimLockedTokenByPercentage](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L168) function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user or admin should call `claimLockedTokenByPercentage` function with passing 1 so that 100% of locked tokens can be claimed, or any other preferred percentage of tokens he want to claim will also be fine. eg- 60,70,80% etc.

### External Pre-conditions

the user or the admin calls the `claimLockedTokenByPercentage` function.

### Attack Path

Lets take some values as examples to see the rounding occuring.
Note that the natspec of the function explicitly says `between 0 and 1` and `1 for 100%`. but will take egs with 1-100 numbers for more clarity
1. The user calls the `claimLockedTokenByPercentage`
2. The amount of tokens will be computed as [(getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, token) * percentage) / 1e18);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L190)
3. so for eg the lockedAmount is 1000e6 USDC. Also note that in the README it is clearly stated that "Tokens like USDC,USDT can work.".
4. So the calculation will be like - `1000e6 * 90(percentage) / 1e18 = 0.00000009` As can be seen this rounds down to 0. Also note that here I took a much greater value than stated in the natspec that was 1 for 100%, That will also round to 0 of course.
5. Now the `_claimLockedToken` internal function will be called with amount as 0 due to the rounding shown above.


### Impact

The impact is pretty severe and high here. That being said Firstly, the users will not be able to claim his specified percentage of the `lockedTokens` they want to. Secondly, Their `vesting plans` will be [resetted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L288) with the same amount as before. Thirdly, this will also result in the [penalty](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking-and hard1k7724/blob/d6dfc6683a21bcde5465ce4848cd7f302a2e3ef0/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290) being round down to 0 as well and the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` not receiving any penalty for them.

### PoC

```solidity
	function claimLockedTokenByPercentage(address token, uint256 percentage) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
		_claimLockedToken(token, msg.sender, (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, token) * percentage) / 1e18); //AUDIT- this will round down to 0
	}
```

```solidity
	function getLockedAmountsForToken(address user, address token) public view returns (uint256) {
		return vestingPlans[token][user].lockedAmount();
	}
```

```solidity
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();


		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);  <--
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;  <--


		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);


		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);


		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
```

```solidity
	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
		self.startTime = block.timestamp;
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
		self.amount = amount; 
		self.claimedAmount = 0; <- AUDIT 
		return self;
	}
```


### Mitigation

Refactor the computaion/calculation of the amount of tokens to claim in the `claimLockedtokensByPercentage` function to such that it doesnt down to 0 and returns suitable values to claim.
