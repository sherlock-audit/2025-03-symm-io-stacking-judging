# Reward Distribution Rounding Error & Unintended Duration Extension

### Summary

The _addRewardsForToken function in the symmstaking.sol is responsible for distributing rewards over a predefined duration. However, it suffers from two key issues:

1. Rounding Error in Division:

When calculating the reward rate using integer division (amount / state.duration), Solidity truncates decimals. This can result in a portion of the reward amount being unaccounted for, causing some tokens to remain stuck in the contract rather than being fully distributed.

2. Unintended Extension of Reward Duration:

If _addRewardsForToken is called before the previous reward period finishes, the contract recalculates the rate using both the new amount and any "leftover" rewards. This can lead to an unintended extension of the reward distribution, resulting in users receiving smaller rewards over a longer period.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379

Integer division without precision handling causes loss of reward amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [{Reward Distributor} needs to call] _addRewardsForToken to set {state.rate} to 0 due to integer division truncation when amount < state.duration.
2. [{Reward Distributor} needs to call] _addRewardsForToken before state.periodFinish to trigger unexpected extension of the reward period.
3. [{Reward Distributor} needs to call] _addRewardsForToken with a small amount that does not distribute rewards properly due to rounding errors.
4. [{Contract must allow] multiple calls to _addRewardsForToken before state.periodFinish so that each call extends the period further.
5. [{Contract state must allow] state.periodFinish to be modified each time _addRewardsForToken is called, instead of keeping a fixed period.
6. [{state.duration} must be greater than amount] for integer division to cause reward loss.

### External Pre-conditions

1. [{Reward Distributor} must be able to repeatedly call _addRewardsForToken] without restrictions on frequency or cooldown periods.
2. [{Token Transfers} must be successful] to allow the contract to receive and manage the rewards properly.
3. [{Gas Prices} must be low] to allow an attacker or reward distributor to execute multiple small _addRewardsForToken calls without incurring significant costs.
4. [{No External Watchdogs or Governance Controls} must exist] to prevent or revert unintended reward period extensions.
5. [{Automated Reward Distributors} must not verify final state.periodFinish] allowing an extended vesting period without detection.
6. [{No Minimum Reward Amount Check} in _addRewardsForToken], allowing very small reward amounts to be processed, leading to significant rounding errors.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Rounding Error in Reward Calculation
Assume state.duration = 1000 seconds and amount = 500 tokens.
The reward rate is calculated as:
state.rate = amount / state.duration; // 500 / 1000 = 0 (integer division)
Since Solidity truncates decimals, state.rate becomes 0, meaning no rewards are distributed.
As a result, 500 tokens remain stuck in the contract, never reaching the users.

Scenario 2: Unintended Extension of Reward Duration
Assume state.periodFinish is set to end in 10 minutes.
A new reward amount is added 5 minutes before the end.
The remaining time is 5 minutes, and the leftover rewards (remaining * state.rate) are factored into the new rate calculation.
The new reward duration is reset to another full cycle (block.timestamp + state.duration).
This extends the distribution period beyond the originally intended duration, reducing the per-period reward amounts.


### Impact

1. Rounding Error in Reward Rate Calculation
Some rewards may remain stuck in the contract due to Solidityâ€™s integer division truncation.
Over time, these accumulated amounts could significantly reduce the total rewards distributed to users.
The protocol may need to perform manual interventions to correct the issue, increasing maintenance overhead.

2. Unintended Reward Duration Extension
Rewards may be distributed over a longer-than-intended duration.
Users expecting rewards to be fully distributed within the original timeframe may receive smaller rewards per period.
This could create misalignment between protocol incentives and user expectations, potentially discouraging participation in the reward system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Prevent Rounding Errors in Reward Calculation
Use fixed-point arithmetic or store additional precision when calculating the reward rate.
Multiply the amount before division to maintain precision:

state.rate = (amount * 1e18) / state.duration;
When distributing rewards, convert back using state.rate / 1e18.

2. Ensure Reward Duration Does Not Extend Unintentionally
Prevent reward recalculation from increasing the period:

if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;

    // Ensure the period does not extend beyond the original end time
    state.periodFinish = state.periodFinish;
}
This ensures that while leftover rewards are included, the distribution period does not extend beyond its intended duration.
