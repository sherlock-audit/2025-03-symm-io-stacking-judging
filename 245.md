# Missing Check in `notifyRewardAmount()` Allows Infinite Reward Accumulation & Blocks Reward Configuration

### Summary

The lack of a `totalSupply > 0` check in `notifyRewardAmount()` allows any user to repeatedly add rewards when no tokens are staked, causing `pendingRewards[token]` to accumulate indefinitely. This results in a permanent lock on `configureRewardToken()`, preventing reward token whitelist updates.

Additionally, if the admin attempts to withdraw these user-inaccessible rewards for redistribution once staking resumes, the calculation would at best be an estimate, as the contract does not explicitly track undistributed rewards.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, `notifyRewardAmount()` does not check whether `totalSupply` is zero before adding new rewards:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
Since `pendingRewards[token]` is updated regardless of whether stakers exist, it continues growing indefinitely when `totalSupply == 0`.

`pendingRewards[token]` then prevents `configureRewardToken()` from executing when the whitelist status of a reward token needs to be set to [`false`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L319) due to:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320

```solidity
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
Additionally, the admin cannot accurately determine how much of the contract’s balance consists of user-inaccessible rewards, as the contract does not differentiate between earned but unclaimed rewards and undistributed rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `totalSupply` must be exactly 0 (no users are staking).
2. A user (anyone, since `notifyRewardAmount()` is permissionless) must call `notifyRewardAmount()` to add rewards.
3. Rewards will not be distributed because no one is staked, leading to indefinite accumulation.
4. `pendingRewards[token]` will increase beyond 10, permanently blocking `configureRewardToken()`.
5. The admin later attempts to recover these accumulated rewards via [`rescueTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343), but cannot determine the exact amount that should be redistributed once staking resumes. This is especially the case if `totalSupply == 0` happens in the future when all stakers fully withdraw their staked `SYMM` tokens.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract must be deployed and no deposit activities have materialized while rewards have been sent into the contract via `notifyRewardAmount()`, or all users must have unstaked all their tokens, setting `totalSupply == 0` in either scenario.
2. Gas prices must be low enough for users to spam `notifyRewardAmount()`, causing `pendingRewards[token]` to grow/stay indefinitely.

### Attack Path

1. For simplicity, let's assume the staking contract has [no active stakers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L240) (`totalSupply == 0`) for quite awhile after deployment although empty `totalSupply` could also happen in the future if all stakers were to make a full withdrawal. 

2. Any user repeatedly calls `notifyRewardAmount()` for various tokens that have been [whitelisted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L318), separately [assigning `pendingRewards[token]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L288) with 11 wei that will not be poised for distribution.

3. No mechanism removes excess `pendingRewards[token]`, leading to indefinite accumulation. This is because each `pendingRewards[token]` can only be decremented when the internal function, `_claimRewardsFor()`, is invoked to claim rewards for a given user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L392

```solidity
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
```
4. When an admin attempts to call `configureRewardToken()` to [un-whitelist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L318-L319) the reward token, it fails permanently due to [`(pendingRewards[token] > 10)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) even if all [users have claimed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L262-L265) their rewards or the [admin has claimed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L298-L302) rewards on behalf of all the users.

5. The staking contract becomes partially/fully bricked, preventing whitelisting updates to the reward system.

6. The admin later attempts to recover these rewards for redistribution, but since the contract does not track truly undistributed rewards, the amount withdrawn is at best an estimate especially when all users might have [`withdrawn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L257) all their `SYMM` tokens, setting `totalSupply == 0` again.

### Impact

- Protocol governance is disrupted because reward token configuration becomes permanently blocked for un-whitelisting. 
- Admin cannot accurately redistribute withdrawn rewards, leading to potential misallocation or loss of fairness in the reward system.

Additionally, per readme:

> All restricted roles are trusted. For example, in the staking contract, the number of reward tokens will not exceed 10–20.

`rewardTokens.length` will be forced to go way beyond the intended length as a workaround, potentially leading to OOG in `_updateRewardsStates()` and `_claimRewardsFor()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L407-L408

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L386-L387

```solidity
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent these issues, refactor `notifyRewardAmount()` ensuring that the logic skips `pendingRewards` and redirects the incoming funds to a pre-defined redistribution address when there are no active stakers:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292

```diff
+        address public distributionAddress; // Set this during initialization

	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

-			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
-			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
-			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);

+                        if (totalSupply != 0) {
+                            // Normal behavior: Add rewards to pendingRewards and update reward calculations
+                            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+                            pendingRewards[token] += amount;
+                            _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);

+                            hasAllocatedRewards = true; // Mark that at least one reward was allocated
+                        } else {
+                            // Redirect rewards to a predefined distribution address when no one is staking
+                            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, distributionAddress, amount);
+                        }
		}
-		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
+                // Emit event only if rewards were actually allocated to the staking contract
+                if (hasAllocatedRewards) {
+		    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
+                }
	}
```

Note: The drawback of the above fix will have the initial stakers miss out on some rewards. If that's a concern, simply have `pendingRewards[token] += amount` omitted from the else clause and keep `IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)` and `_addRewardsForToken(token, amount)`, and forget about the directing funds to `distributionAddress`. This will nonetheless make calculating the user inaccessible rewards tedious off chain prior to retrieving the respective reward tokens via `rescueTokens()`. In that case, please consider my other report pertaining to code refactoring on `deposit()` that will accurately handle the unclaimable rewards.
