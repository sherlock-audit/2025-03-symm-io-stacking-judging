# Users can halt their reward updates by setting the rate to zero, effectively suspending the incremental compensation mechanism

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount()` function lacks access control mechanisms, enabling users to easily invoke the function and manipulate the state of specific tokens without proper authorization. when the amount is zero, the code invokes continue to abort the current iteration and proceed to the next loop. However, imprecise integer division within the `_addRewardsForToken()` function may result in rate being inadvertently set to zero.

### Root Cause

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}

	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

```
The `notifyRewardAmount()` function updates the rate by calling the `_addRewardsForToken()` function. When `block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish`, the rate is calculated as `amount / state.duration`, with duration typically set to 1 weeks (DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION). In this scenario, if a user sets the amount to 1, the calculation becomes 1 / 1 weeks, resulting in the rate being set to zero.

When `block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish` is false, the calculation becomes `(amount + (remaining * state.rate)) / state.duration`. This case exhibits similar problematic behavior, potentially leading to unintended rate zero conditions.

```solidity
	function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return
			((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
			rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
	}
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210
```
The rate value is utilized in the `earned()` function for calculating rewards. When set to zero, it introduces critical disruptions to the reward update mechanism.


### Internal Pre-conditions

empty

### External Pre-conditions

empty

### Attack Path

Call the `notifyRewardAmount()` function to set the rate of a specific token to zero

### Impact

users can manipulate the reward rates to zero for each token, thereby introducing critical vulnerabilities and disrupting the entire reward distribution mechanism

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract asdf is Test {
    uint256 amount = 1;
    uint256 DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1 weeks; 

    function testasdf() public {
        uint256 rate = amount / DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
        console.log("rate : ", rate);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

When the amount is zero, the rate is not updated. However, during the actual update process, the rate can be set to 1 with an integer greater than zero. Considering this scenario, developers should implement precise integer division or establish a minimum amount threshold to mitigate potential manipulation.
