# `SymmVesting::_addLiquidityProcess()` reverts whenever `lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount < unlockedAmount`

### Summary

`SymmVesting::_addLiquidityProcess()` resets the vesting plan with `lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount`, so users can add from their `SYMM` vesting position to `SYMM_LP`. However, whenever the unlocked amount of the `SYMM_LP` is bigger than the `lockedAmount` plus the new `lpAmount`, it reverts as per an outdated [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231).

### Root Cause

In `Vesting:231`, the `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();` check is not needed and actually stops users from correctly resetting their vested positions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User adds liquidity of their vested `SYMM`.
2. Some of the liquidity of the newly vested `SYMM_LP` position unlocks
3. After 50% of the vesting duration passes, the unlocked amount becomes bigger than the locked amount. User tries to add liquidity of their vested `SYMM` with an amount smaller than the unlocked amount and it reverts.

### Impact

DoSed adding liquidity under certain conditions, if enough time passes and enough liquidity was added initially, it will DoS completely the ability to add the leftover liquidity to the `SYMM_LP` vested positions. This causes loss of fees for the user.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Remove the mentioned check.
