# Dos of remove reward token because of pendingRewards

### Summary

In the function configureRewardToken(), when passing the status as false, it checks whether pendingRewards for the corresponding token is greater than 10. If this condition is met, it assumes that there are still rewards left to distribute and reverts the transaction. This prevents removing a token with remaining rewards from the rewardTokens list.

### Root Cause

The issue arises because when new rewards are added via the _addRewardsForToken() function, which is called from notifyRewardAmount(), precision loss occurs during division, leading to the accumulation of dust greater than 10. This happens when calculating rate, where amount is divided by duration.

Since the default duration is one week, which in seconds is:

>7 * 24 * 3600 > 10

dividing by this value can leave a remainder greater than 10. As a result, certain tokens may never be removed from the list, which is a broken functionality. This leads to loss of user funds due to excessive gas fees and, in the long run, could cause reverts due to Out of Gas (OOG) in places where for loops are used.
