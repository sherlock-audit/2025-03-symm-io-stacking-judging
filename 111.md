# A malicious actor can dilute the reward rate for all stakers

### Summary

The [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) can be called by anyone. A malicious actor can dilute the rewards for all stakers by  adding a tiny amount of reward through the function.

### Root Cause

The root case stem from `notifyRewardAmount()`. The first issue is that the function can be called by anyone. The second issue is in  the following function invoked in notifyRewardAmount:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
As it can be seen from the code above, The  function causes remaining rewards to be spread over a new full duration. This can be easily exploited by anyone(see the attack below)

### Internal Pre-conditions

There must be some rewards allocated for earlier stakers

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following  scenario:
let's say initially there are 700 tokens allocated for stakers for 7 days.
Initial rate = 700/7 = 100 tokens per day
After 3 days has passed:
Leftover rewards = 4 days 100 tokens = 400 tokens
A malicious actor makes a call to `notifyRewardAmount` by adding a tiny amount of reward(let's say 1 token).  Based on `_addRewardsForToken()`(provided above) function the new rate will be:

- New reward amount = 1 token
- New rate calculation: (1 + 400) / 7 days = ~57.28 tokens per day

The reward period is  resetted to a new full duration(another 7 days) and the rate dropped significantly (from 100 to ~57.28 tokens per day)
The attacker can repeat this many times, causing stakers wait weeks even months.


### Impact

Considering the attack can be repeatedly executed by low cost and it forces all stakers in the protocol  to wait much longer than intended for their rewards, I set the severity  to High.

### PoC
1-The tests in symmStaking.behavior.ts shows notifyRewardAmount is expected to be called by admin.
2-In the code, [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) can be called by anyone
3- See attack Path




### Mitigation

Restrict notifyRewardAmount function call by `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`. However in my opinion, this would not be enough. Because even if the function is restricted to admin call, The admin unintentionally can provide tiny (even 0 ) amount of rewards for some tokens . Therefore it would be more secure to also enforce `min reward amount` and *maintain the original reward period instead of extending it*
```solidity
// Add minimum reward amount
uint256 public constant MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT = ...; 

function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {  //Add access control
    
         ...
        if (amount < MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT) revert InsufficientRewardAmount();  //Add minimum check
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}

function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
        state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
    } else {
        // Keep the original period finish time
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        state.rate = (amount + (remaining * state.rate)) / remaining;  // Only distribute over remaining time
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
}
```
