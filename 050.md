# Early Unlock Penalty Distribution Implementation Contradicts Documented Tokenomics

### Summary and Impact  

The early unlock penalty mechanism in the vesting contract does not follow the documented tokenomics. According to the official documentation, a 50% penalty for early unlocking should be split so that 80% benefits non–unlockers (for example, through redistribution) and 20% goes to ecosystem incentives. Instead, the code subtracts the entire penalty from the unlocked amount and sends it all to a single address designated as the penalty receiver. This misallocation contradicts the expected behavior, undermining the protocol’s economic model and potentially causing disputes among stakeholders. In practice, a user opting to unlock tokens early ends up receiving only half of the tokens they expect, while all the withheld tokens accumulate at one central point, a scenario that deviates from the system’s invariants and documented design.

**Vulnerability Details**

During an early unlock operation, the contract calculates the penalty as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L299

This snippet clearly shows that the entire penalty (50% of the claimed amount) is transferred exclusively to the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`. There is no logic to split the penalty between non–unlockers and the ecosystem incentive pool as specified. 

To illustrate, consider a user with a vesting plan containing 1,000 tokens. If the user attempts to unlock 200 tokens early, the expected behavior (per documentation) would be:
- A 50% penalty of 100 tokens, split into an 80–20 distribution (i.e. 80 tokens redirected to non–unlockers and 20 tokens allocated to ecosystem incentives).

However, in the current implementation:
- The user receives 100 tokens (200 – 100).
- All 100 tokens are sent to the single `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

The following test snippet (from our Hardhat tests) demonstrates this misbehavior:

```typescript
// Calculate the expected penalty: claimAmount * 50%
const expectedPenalty = claimAmount.mul(lockedClaimPenalty).div(ethers.constants.WeiPerEther);

// Record balances before the claim
const userBalanceBefore = await token.balanceOf(user.address);
const penaltyReceiverBalanceBefore = await token.balanceOf(penaltyReceiver.address);

// User calls claimLockedToken to unlock a specific amount early
await vesting.connect(user).claimLockedToken(token.address, claimAmount);

// Record balances after the claim
const userBalanceAfter = await token.balanceOf(user.address);
const penaltyReceiverBalanceAfter = await token.balanceOf(penaltyReceiver.address);

// The user should receive (claimAmount - expectedPenalty)
const expectedUserGain = claimAmount.sub(expectedPenalty);

expect(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore)).to.equal(expectedUserGain);
expect(penaltyReceiverBalanceAfter.sub(penaltyReceiverBalanceBefore)).to.equal(expectedPenalty);
```

In this scenario, the entire penalty amount ends up with the penalty receiver rather than being split, contradicting the intended tokenomics. Such a misallocation can erode trust among users who expect a fair distribution mechanism and may create centralization of funds in one address, a risk factor if that key is ever compromised.

**Recommendations**

To rectify this issue, the contract should implement a multi-split mechanism. One approach is to calculate the total penalty and then divide it into two parts,a stakers’ share and an ecosystem incentive share,according to the 80–20 ratio specified in the documentation.
