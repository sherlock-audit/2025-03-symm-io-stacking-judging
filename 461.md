# Unintentional Approval Persistence in _addLiquidity Function: Risk of Excessive Token Authorization

### Summary

The _addLiquidity function approves tokens for the PERMIT2 and ROUTER contracts, but it fails to reset the approval amount after the transaction completes, leaving an excessive allowance. This could lead to unintended consequences where other transactions could unintentionally use the unreset approval, potentially allowing a malicious actor to drain tokens or affect subsequent liquidity operations.

### Root Cause

The function approves tokens (symm and usdc) to the PERMIT2 and ROUTER contracts for liquidity provision, but there is no mechanism in place to reset or decrease the approval after the transaction is complete.

If a portion of the USDC approved for liquidity addition is not used (i.e., not all usdcIn is spent), the remaining approved amount remains intact, creating the potential for unwanted or unexpected use of the tokens in the future.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

The failure to reset the token approvals to zero after liquidity addition can result in excessive approval exposure, leaving users vulnerable to potential token drains or unauthorized transactions if the contract's approval is exploited.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reset the Token Approvals: After the liquidity addition is complete, it is critical to call the approve function with an allowance of 0 to reset the approval state for both PERMIT2 and ROUTER contracts.
