# Attacker will exploit rounding errors to reduce rewards for stakers

### Summary

The reward rate calculation in the contract uses integer division without proper precision scaling, which leads to cumulative rounding errors. Specifically, when new rewards are added via the `notifyRewardAmount` function, the contract recalculates the reward rate using the following logic:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```

Since Solidity’s integer division truncates any fractional values, a portion of the reward is lost every time this function is called. This loss becomes significant when the token used has low decimal precision (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals). An attacker can exploit this flaw by repeatedly calling `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal reward amounts, which repeatedly triggers the division and increases the cumulative loss. Over time, this exploitation causes the actual rewards distributed to stakers to be significantly lower than intended, ultimately reducing or even nullifying the rewards for legitimate participants.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol` the function `_addRewardsForToken` recalculates the reward rate by dividing the reward amount by `state.duration` without applying a scaling factor, which leads to integer truncation and cumulative rounding loss. Consider the following excerpts from the code:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```

For example, if the reward amount is `100e6` (representing 100 tokens with 6 decimals) and `state.duration` is 604800 seconds (1 week), the calculation is:

```solidity
100e6 / 604800 = 165   // Actual value ~165.359, but truncated to 165
165 * 604800 = 99.792e6  // Total distributed amount is lower than intended
```

When new rewards are added during an ongoing reward period, the addition of `leftover` still suffers from the same truncation:

```solidity
uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

This truncation, when repeated across multiple calls (especially with very small reward amounts), compounds the rounding error, resulting in a significant cumulative loss of rewards for stakers over time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An attacker needs to call `notifyRewardAmount` repeatedly with extremely low reward amounts (e.g., 1 unit/wei) to trigger the rounding loss on each call.  
2. The reward token (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals) and the default duration (1 week) combine to produce a significant remainder during the division, leading to an accumulating loss.  
3. The function lacks restrictions or a minimum threshold on the reward amount, allowing the attacker to repeatedly exploit the rounding issue.

### External Pre-conditions

 No specific external protocol conditions are required; the vulnerability exists solely due to the internal logic of the contract.

### Attack Path

1. Setup Scenario:  
   - Assume the reward token is deployed with 6 decimals (e.g., USDC), and the intended total reward amount is 100,000 tokens.  
     - In smallest units: 100,000 tokens × 10⁶ = 100,000,000,000 units.  
   - The reward duration is set to 604,800 seconds (1 week).  
   - The correct reward rate should ideally be calculated as:  
     ```solidity
     correct_rate = floor(100,000,000,000 / 604800) ≈ 165337 units per second
     ```  
     Multiplying back:  
     ```solidity
     165337 * 604800 = 99,995,817,600 units
     ```  
     This results in a loss of:  
     ```solidity
     100,000,000,000 - 99,995,817,600 = 4,182,400 units
     ```  
     (approximately 4.1824 tokens lost due to rounding in one full, honest reward notification).

2. Exploitation via Minimal Reward Calls (6-decimal token):  
   - The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a reward amount of **1 unit** (1 wei equivalent for a 6-decimal token).  
     - The function computes:  
       ```solidity
       state.rate = 1 / 604800;  // Integer division yields 0
       ```  
     - As a result, the 1 unit is effectively lost because it does not contribute to any positive reward rate.
   - **Each call with 1 unit results in a loss of 1 unit.**

3. Cumulative Loss Calculation (6-decimal token): 
   - To completely erode a reward pool of 100,000 tokens (100,000,000,000 units), the attacker would need to call the function:  
     ```solidity
     100,000,000,000 calls (each losing 1 unit)
     ```
   - In practice, repeated calls—even if not erasing the entire pool—could gradually reduce the distributable rewards, eventually causing significant under-distribution to legitimate stakers.

4. Comparison with 18-Decimal Token Scenario:  
   - Now assume the reward token uses 18 decimals.  
     - The intended total reward amount in smallest units is:  
       100,000 tokens × 10¹⁸ = 100,000e18 units.
   - The reward rate calculation would be:  
     ```solidity
     correct_rate = floor(100,000e18 / 604800)
     ```
     with a similarly computed rounding error.
   - When the attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei (the smallest unit for an 18-decimal token), the computation is:  
     ```solidity
     state.rate = 1 / 604800;  // Integer division yields 0
     ```  
   - Each such call loses 1 wei.
   - To erode the entire reward pool:  
     ```solidity
     100,000e18 calls (i.e. 100,000 × 10¹⁸ calls)
     ```
     which is an astronomically high number, but even a fraction of this repeated abuse could reduce rewards significantly.

5. Overall Attack Summary:  
   - By repeatedly calling `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal reward amounts (1 wei), an attacker leverages the integer division truncation in the reward rate calculation.  
   - Each call effectively adds a rounding loss of 1 unit, which, if repeated a sufficient number of times, can cumulatively erode the entire rewards available to stakers.  
   - This vulnerability can lead to a scenario where stakers receive far less reward than intended, or, in extreme cases, no rewards at all.

### Impact

The precision loss caused by integer division results in a direct reduction of the reward pool available to stakers. For instance, when distributing 100,000 tokens (with 6 decimals, equaling 100,000,000,000 units) over a duration of 604,800 seconds, the ideal reward rate might be around 165337 units per second. However, due to truncation, each honest reward notification loses roughly 4,182,400 units overall. While a single call with 1 unit (or 1 wei) might seem negligible, it contributes a loss of 1 unit per call. In a scenario where an attacker repeatedly calls the `notifyRewardAmount` function with 1 unit, the cumulative effect can be devastating. For example, if an attacker makes 1,000,000 such calls, stakers lose 1,000,000 units from the reward pool. Although this loss represents only 0.001% of the total for 6-decimal tokens, repeated exploitation can quickly add up to a significant shortfall.  
  
In the case of tokens with 18 decimals, the loss per call is still 1 wei, but because the absolute numbers are much larger (e.g., 100,000 tokens equal 100,000e18 units), the relative impact per call is lower. Nevertheless, given the possibility of an unlimited number of calls, even a minuscule loss per call can accumulate over time to a level where the effective rewards distributed to stakers are substantially diminished, potentially approaching zero if the attack is sustained.

    PoC Contract: VulnerableStakingPoC

    This contract demonstrates the cumulative rounding error vulnerability.
    In a real scenario, the staking contract calculates the reward rate by dividing the reward amount
    by a fixed duration (DURATION). Due to integer division, any fractional remainder is discarded.
    An attacker can repeatedly call notifyRewardAmount with a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) to introduce
    tiny rounding losses that accumulate over time, effectively reducing the rewards available for stakers.

    Example Scenario (6-decimal token):
    - Suppose a normal reward deposit is 100,000 tokens (with 6 decimals):
        totalReward = 100,000 * 1e6 = 100,000,000,000 units.
    - The ideal reward rate should be:
        ideal_rate = 100,000,000,000 / 604800 ≈ 165337 units per second.
    - However, due to integer division, the calculated rate will be slightly lower.
    - If an attacker calls notifyRewardAmount repeatedly with 1 wei (which is less than the duration divisor),
      each call results in:
        1 / 604800 = 0 (rate = 0), causing a loss of 1 unit per call.
    - Repeating this attack many times can erode the reward pool over time.

    The following contract simulates:
    1. A normal reward deposit via depositReward().
    2. An attacker spamming notifyRewardAmount with 1 wei via attack().

contract VulnerableStakingPoC {
    uint256 public constant DURATION = 604800; // 1 week in seconds
    uint256 public rate;
    uint256 public periodFinish;
    uint256 public totalRewards; // Total rewards notified

    constructor() {
        periodFinish = block.timestamp;
    }

    // Function to simulate notifying rewards (vulnerable to rounding errors)
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 amount) public {
        // If current period is over, calculate new rate from scratch.
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            // Integer division: e.g., if amount is 1 wei, then 1 / 604800 = 0
            rate = amount / DURATION;
        } else {
            // If the reward period is still active, add the leftover rewards.

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rate;
            rate = (amount + leftover) / DURATION;
        }
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + DURATION;
        totalRewards += amount;
    }

    // Function to simulate a normal reward deposit (e.g., by an honest reward provider)
    function depositReward(uint256 amount) public {
        notifyRewardAmount(amount);
    }

    // Attack function: an attacker calls notifyRewardAmount repeatedly with 1 wei
    function attack(uint256 calls) public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls; i++) {
            notifyRewardAmount(1);
        }
    }

    // Helper functions to read the current reward rate and total rewards can be added as needed.
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
// 1. Implement Fixed-Point Arithmetic in _addRewardsForToken:
uint256 constant SCALE = 1e18;

if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = (amount * SCALE) / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = ((amount * SCALE) + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```

```solidity
// 2. Enforce Minimum Reward Amounts in notifyRewardAmount:
uint256 constant MIN_REWARD_AMOUNT = 1e6; // example threshold for a token with 6 decimals

for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];
    if (amount < MIN_REWARD_AMOUNT) {
        revert RewardAmountTooLow(amount);
    }
    // existing logic continues...
}
```

```solidity
// 3. Restrict Access to notifyRewardAmount by adding an access control modifier:
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)   // <-- Added modifier to restrict access
{
    // existing function body...
}
```

```solidity
// 4. Accumulate Remainders in _addRewardsForToken by tracking the residual amounts:
// Add a new field to TokenRewardState: uint256 remainder;
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    uint256 scaledAmount = amount * SCALE;
    uint256 total = scaledAmount + state.remainder;
    state.rate = total / state.duration;
    state.remainder = total % state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 scaledAmount = amount * SCALE;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    uint256 total = scaledAmount + leftover + state.remainder;
    state.rate = total / state.duration;
    state.remainder = total % state.duration;
}
```
