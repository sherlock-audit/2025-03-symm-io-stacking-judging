# Admin will be unable to remove outdated reward tokens, leading to claim function failure for users

#### Summary
The strict condition in `configureRewardToken` will cause an accumulation of outdated reward tokens for stakers, as the admin will be unable to remove tokens that still have pending rewards. This will force the admin to add more reward tokens to incentivize staking, leading to an uncontrollable increase in reward tokens. If any external reward token is paused or blacklists a user, that user will be unable to claim rewards, and the admin will be unable to remove that token, breaking the reward system.

#### Root Cause
In [SymmStaking.configureRewardToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312-L312), the condition `if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);` prevents the removal of a token from the reward list if there are pending rewards. This design choice leads to an ever-growing reward token list when outdated tokens cannot be removed.

#### Internal Pre-conditions
1. The admin calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to remove a token.
2. `pendingRewards[token]` is greater than 10, which prevents the removal of the token.
3. The protocol aims to maintain an attractive staking reward system, adding new reward tokens over time.

#### External Pre-conditions
1. An external reward token admin pauses their token or prevents transfers for specific users (e.g., blacklist).
2. A user eligible for rewards holds an affected token and is unable to claim rewards.

#### Attack Path
1. The admin attempts to remove a deprecated reward token using `configureRewardToken`.
2. The function reverts due to pending rewards exceeding 10.
3. To maintain staking incentives, the admin adds new reward tokens.
4. Over time, the number of reward tokens grows beyond the protocol's expected limit.
5. If a tokenâ€™s admin externally restricts transfers (e.g., pauses the token or blacklists users), affected users cannot claim rewards.
6. The claim function fails for these users, and the admin cannot remove the token to fix the issue.

#### Impact
The affected users suffer an approximate loss of funds as they cannot withdraw their accumulated rewards. Even if each individual token remains claimable, users may still be unable to claim rewards due to an out-of-gas error when iterating over an excessive number of reward tokens.
Additionally, the **protocol will accumulate excessive reward tokens**, potentially exceeding the intended limit (e.g., 10-20 tokens), leading to operational issues and increased gas costs.

#### PoC


#### Mitigation
Modify the `configureRewardToken` function to allow forced removal of tokens, even with pending rewards.
