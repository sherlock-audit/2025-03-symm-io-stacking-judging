# Inadequate Slippage Protection in Liquidity Addition Risks User Losses

### Summary

The weak default slippage tolerance in _addLiquidity will cause financial losses for liquidity providers as users will receive fewer LP tokens than expected due to an inadequate 1% slippage protection in volatile or large transactions.



### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol:186, the _addLiquidity function sets a default slippage tolerance of 1% ((expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100) when minLpAmount is zero, which is insufficient for large transactions or volatile market conditions, exposing users to potential losses.



### Internal Pre-conditions


Users need to call addLiquidity or addLiquidityByPercentage to set symmAmount to be at least 1 SYMM token to trigger liquidity addition.

The minLpAmount parameter needs to be set to exactly 0 by the user to trigger the default 1% slippage tolerance.

The POOL contract needs to have non-zero symmBalance and usdcBalance to allow getLiquidityQuote to provide a valid expectedLpAmount.



### External Pre-conditions


The SYMM/USDC pool (via POOL) needs to experience a price fluctuation (e.g., SYMM price drops by more than 1% within a block) to exceed the default slippage tolerance.

The ROUTER contract needs to return an LP token amount lower than the expected value due to market movement or front-running.



### Attack Path


User calls addLiquidity(1000e18, 0, 0) to add 1000 SYMM to the SYMM/USDC pool, passing minLpAmount = 0 to rely on the default 1% slippage tolerance.

The getLiquidityQuote function calculates expectedLpAmount based on current pool balances (e.g., 1000 LP tokens).

An attacker front-runs the transaction by swapping SYMM for USDC in the pool, reducing the SYMM price by 2% (e.g., shifting balances from 8000 SYMM / 2000 USDC to 8200 SYMM / 1950 USDC).

The _addLiquidity function sets minLpAmountWithSlippage = (1000 * 99) / 100 = 990 LP tokens, but the ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional call returns only 980 LP tokens due to the price shift.

The transaction succeeds, but the user receives 980 LP tokens instead of the expected ~1000, losing 20 LP tokens (approximately 2% of value) due to inadequate slippage protection.



### Impact

The liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss of up to 2% of their expected LP tokens due to insufficient slippage protection in volatile conditions. The attacker may gain this value through arbitrage, while the protocol remains unaffected directly but risks user dissatisfaction.

        console.log("SYMM used:", amountsIn[0] / 1e18, "SYMM");
        console.log("USDC used:", amountsIn[1] / 1e6, "USDC");
        console.log("LP tokens received:", lpAmount);

        // Expected LP tokens without slippage: ~1000
        // With 2% slippage, expect ~980
        assertTrue(lpAmount < 990, "User received too many LP tokens despite slippage");
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To address the inadequate slippage protection issue, implement the following mitigation steps:
Require Explicit minLpAmount:

Modify _addLiquidity to revert if minLpAmount is zero, forcing users to specify an acceptable minimum:

```solidity

function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    require(minLpAmount > 0, "Must specify minimum LP amount");
    (uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);
    if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
    // ... rest of function ...
    if (lpAmount < minLpAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();
}
```
Update addLiquidity and addLiquidityByPercentage to propagate this requirement.
