# Improper Token Rescue Handling in SymmStaking Contract Could Lead to Reward Manipulation and Contract Instability

### Summary:
The `rescueTokens` function in the Symmetric Staking contract allows the admin to withdraw tokens from the contract, but it does not include sufficient checks to prevent potential misuse of the function. Specifically, the function does not prevent the admin from withdrawing reward tokens, which can reduce the accumulated rewards for users. Additionally, it doesn't account for whether the balance of a specific token, such as reward tokens, is sufficient to cover pending rewards. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as reverting transactions due to insufficient rewards or leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

### Root Cause:
- **Lack of Checks for Reward Tokens**: The `rescueTokens` function does not differentiate between regular tokens and reward tokens. If reward tokens are withdrawn, the accumulated rewards for users may be affected, leading to potential discrepancies or errors when users attempt to claim rewards.
- **No Safeguard for Pending Rewards**: There is no safeguard to ensure that the contract’s available reward tokens are sufficient to cover pending rewards. If the reward token balance is reduced by an admin withdrawal, it could result in users being unable to claim their rewards or the function failing due to insufficient funds.


### Internal Pre-conditions:
- **Admin Role**: The function is callable only by the admin (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`), so any potential misuse or by mistake do so.
- **Token Whitelisting**: There may be specific tokens that are whitelisted for rewards, but the current implementation allows withdrawal of any token without distinguishing between reward and non-reward tokens.

### External Pre-conditions:
- **Reward Tokens**: The contract may be using reward tokens that are accumulated by users through staking or other mechanisms, and the balance of those tokens should be protected from unintended withdrawals.
- **Pending Rewards**: Users may have pending rewards, and these rewards must be accounted for when making withdrawals to ensure the system's integrity.

### Impact:
- **Loss of User Rewards**: If reward tokens are withdrawn by the admin, users' accumulated rewards could be reduced, causing discrepancies and potentially leading to them being unable to claim their full rewards.
- **Contract Instability**: The contract’s functionality could be disrupted if reward tokens are withdrawn without adequate checks, potentially preventing users from interacting with the contract or causing errors in reward calculations.


### Attack Path:
1. **Admin Misuse**: The admin could withdraw reward tokens, either accidentally or maliciously, causing the available rewards to be less than expected. This would lead to a scenario where users attempt to claim rewards but find insufficient funds available, potentially causing failed transactions or loss of rewards.
2. **Fund Misappropriation**: Without proper checks, the admin could withdraw any tokens, including reward tokens, which would have a direct impact on the reward distribution mechanism. This could be used maliciously to deplete the contract of tokens and disrupt staking operations.


### Mitigation:
1. **Add Reward Token Check**: Modify the `rescueTokens` function to check if the token being withdrawn is a reward token. If it is, the function should revert the transaction to prevent the admin from withdrawing reward tokens.
   ```solidity
   function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
       // Check if the token is a reward token
       if (rewardRate[token] > 0) revert("Cannot withdraw reward token");
       IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
       emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Sufficient Token Balance**: Before allowing the withdrawal, the contract should ensure that the token balance minus any pending rewards for users is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount. If the balance is insufficient, the transaction should revert.
   ```solidity
   function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
       uint256 availableBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - pendingReward[token];
       if (availableBalance < amount) revert("Insufficient balance for rescue");
       if (rewardRate[token] > 0) revert("Cannot withdraw reward token");
       IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
       emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
   }
   ```

3. **Restrict Withdrawal to Only Extra or Non-Reward Tokens**: Ensure that only extra tokens or tokens not associated with rewards are allowed to be withdrawn. This would require a whitelist mechanism or a method to validate whether a token is associated with rewards.
   - **Whitelist Tokens**: Implement a system to whitelist non-reward tokens that are eligible for rescue, preventing any unintended withdrawals of reward tokens.
