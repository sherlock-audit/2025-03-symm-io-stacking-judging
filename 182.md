# Manager couldn't remove reward token due to residual `pendingRewards`

### Summary

The `configureRewardToken` function checks if `pendingRewards[token] > 10` before allowing the `REWARD_MANAGER` to remove a reward token. However, due to dust accumulation in `pendingRewards`, even after all stakers claim their rewards, `pendingRewards[token]` may still be greater than 10, preventing the removal of the reward token.  

### Root Cause
- `state.rate` is updated with increase of `pendingRewards`, but calculation of `state.rate` causes rounding error:
```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		...
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			...
@>			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
@>			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		...
	}

	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@>			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
		...
	}
```
- Stakers claim rewards based on [`balanceOf`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210-L214) and `rewardPerToken`, which causes rounding errors. 
Accumulation of dust leads to residual of `pendingRewards`.
```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
@>				totalSupply);
	}

	function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return
@>			((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
			rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
	}
```
- Considering that dust is generated per claim, the hardcoded threshold value of `10` is too low compared to the number of stakers and claims.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No response

### External Pre-conditions

No response

### Attack Path
1. There are 11 stakers with the same `balanceOf = 10e18`:
totalSupply = 11 * 10e18 = 110e18
2. Adding reward happens:
pendingRewards = 1000e6
rate = 1000e6 / 604800 = 1,653
3. After duration ends, all stakers claims:
rewardPerToken = 604800 * rate * 1e18 / totalSupply= 9,088,494
pendingRewards = 1000e6 - rewardPerToken * balanceOf * 11 / 1e18 = 265,660
4. All stakers claims all reward, but `pendingRewards` is higher than 10.

### Impact

Manager couldn't remove reward token due to residual `pendingRewards`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the tracking logic of `pendingRewards`.
