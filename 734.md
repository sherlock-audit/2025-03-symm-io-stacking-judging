# Issue H-4: Reward Token Removal Allows Reward Drain (Reward Token Whitelist Manipulation)

### Summary

The `configureRewardToken` function allows the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to remove a reward token from the whitelist if `pendingRewards[token] <= 10`. This threshold is arbitrary and doesn’t fully protect against reward draining. An attacker with `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` can notify small reward amounts, remove the token, and rescue the untracked rewards via `rescueTokens`, especially since the Q&A states that "all restricted roles are trusted" but doesn’t guarantee they won’t be compromised.

### Root Cause

Nill

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker with `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `notifyRewardAmount([tokenA], [5])`, adding 5 units of `tokenA` (a whitelisted stablecoin like USDC).
  2. `pendingRewards[tokenA]` becomes 5, which is ≤ 10.
  3. The attacker calls `configureRewardToken(tokenA, false)` to remove `tokenA` from `rewardTokens`. The check `if (pendingRewards[token] > 10)` passes, and `tokenA` is removed.
  4. The 5 units of `tokenA` remain in the contract but are no longer tracked for rewards.
  5. The attacker (with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) calls `rescueTokens(tokenA, 5, attackerAddress)` to withdraw the untracked `tokenA`.
  6. The attacker repeats this process, draining small amounts of rewards over time without distributing them to stakers.

### Impact

Loss of reward tokens intended for stakers, undermining the ecosystem’s integrity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent removal of a reward token if **any** `pendingRewards` exist, not just > 10.
    ```solidity
    if (!status) {
        if (pendingRewards[token] > 0) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
        // Rest of the removal logic...
    }
    ```
  - **Enforce Token Limit:** Add a code-level limit of 20 reward tokens, as stated in the Q&A:
    ```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_REWARD_TOKENS = 20;
    function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        if (status && rewardTokens.length >= MAX_REWARD_TOKENS) revert("Maximum reward tokens reached");
        // Rest of the function...
    }
    ```
