# The attacker can delay or cancel stakers rewards by calling the `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` function with an amount of 0

### Summary

In the [`SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) function an attacker can manipulate the reward distribution timeline. By calling this function with a reward token and an amount of 0, the attacker can extend the reward period arbitrarily, delaying stakers from receiving their rewards. In the worst case, if the remaining undistributed rewards (`leftover`) are low (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374), the attacker can effectively cancel rewards entirely by setting the reward rate to zero.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from how the contract recalculates the reward distribution period. When `notifyRewardAmount` is called, it updates `periodFinish` to a week ahead (`block.timestamp + state.duration`), regardless of whether the provided reward amount is zero. 
In the `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` function, there's no validation to prevent a zero amount from being provided.

### Internal Pre-conditions

For the attacker to cancel the rewards, the undistributed rewards (`leftover`) must be less than 604800.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` function with 0 amount.
2. The contract recalculates `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration`.
3. If `leftover < 604800`, the new rate is calculated as `(0 + leftover) / state.duration = 0`.
4. As a result, rewards for stakers are postponed for another week or canceled entirely if the rate is zero.

### Impact

- Delayed Rewards: Stakers expecting their rewards to be distributed in a short timeframe can have their payouts postponed indefinitely.
- Reward Cancellation: If the leftover balance is insufficient, the entire reward mechanism can be reset to zero, denying stakers their due earnings.
- Malicious actors can repeatedly execute this function, preventing fair reward distribution.

### PoC

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` function to ensure the amount is not zero.
