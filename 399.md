# Any actor can dilute the reward rate by calling notifyRewardAmount() with 1 wei

### Summary

Reward rate can be manipulated, diluted, achievable by anyone through an extension of the reward period.

### Root Cause

### Reward Rate Dilution and Decay Formula  

When rewards are added through [`notifyRewardAmount()`](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L286-L287), the new reward rate is calculated as:  

${state.rate} = \frac{\text{amount} + \text{leftover}}{\text{state.duration}}$


This means that if **1 day has passed in a 7-day reward period**, and an actor adds just **1 wei**, the reward rate will be diluted by an additional day.  

### **Dilution Formula**  
The dilution effect follows the formula:  

$R_x = \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^x \cdot R$  

where:  
- \( R \) is the initial reward rate.  
- \( x \) is the time passed (in days).  
- Each day introduces a **15% dilution** if the total distribution period is 7 days.  

### **Adjusting for Claimed Rewards**  
Each time `notifyRewardAmount()` is called, previously **claimed rewards must be set aside** before recalculating the new rate. Taking this into account, the complete decay formula is:  


$f(x) = R \cdot \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^x \div 7$  

### **Observing the Decay**  
Instead of a **steady** reward ratio, the reward rate follows an **exponential decay function**, as shown in this graph:

### Internal Pre-conditions

On going reward distribution for a specific reward token

### External Pre-conditions

No preconditions needed

### Attack Path

In order to perform this attack, each day call `notifyRewardAmount()` and only supply 1 wei on a freshly opened reward program.  

### Impact

The reward ratio is severly dilluted, which affects the stakers. theoretically no rewards are lost though, just watered down distribution ratio

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider making the addition of rewards for a token non extensive on the reward period
Or enabling access control on `notifyRewardAmount()`
Or to avoid abuse, implement a min amount on  `notifyRewardAmount()`
