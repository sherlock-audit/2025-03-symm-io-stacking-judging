# Vesting Plan Accounting Discrepancy: Claimed Amount Reset Leads to Inconsistent Withdrawals

### Summary

The `Vesting.sol::_claimLockedToken` function allows users to withdraw locked tokens while applying a penalty. However, unlike `_claimUnlockedToken`, it does not increment `vestingPlan.claimedAmount`. Instead, it calls `resetAmount()`, which resets `claimedAmount` to zero and rebases the vesting schedule. This creates an inconsistency where claimed tokens are not properly tracked, potentially allowing users to withdraw more than their allocated amount over time. Additionally, this could lead to incorrect vesting calculations and improper penalty deductions.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the incorrect handling of the `claimedAmount` variable in the `_claimLockedToken` function. Unlike `_claimUnlockedToken`, which properly increments `vestingPlan.claimedAmount`, `_claimLockedToken` only calls `resetAmount()`, which resets `claimedAmount` to zero instead of properly accounting for previously claimed tokens.

Since `resetAmount()` does not preserve the historical claim data and instead reinitializes the vesting plan, the system loses track of how much has already been claimed. This allows users to repeatedly claim locked tokens while bypassing intended tracking mechanisms, potentially leading to over-withdrawals or exploitation of the penalty calculation.

### Impact

1. Incorrect Token Accounting: Since claimedAmount is reset instead of being incremented properly, the system loses track of how many tokens a user has actually claimed. This can lead to users withdrawing more tokens than they are entitled to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before calling `resetAmount()`, ensure that `claimedAmount` is properly updated to reflect any previously claimed tokens.
Modify `_claimLockedToken()` to increment `vestingPlan.claimedAmount` before resetting the vesting plan.

```solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    // **Fix: Properly track claimed amounts before resetting**
    vestingPlan.claimedAmount += amount;

    // Adjust the vesting plan
    vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
    totalVested[token] -= amount;
```
