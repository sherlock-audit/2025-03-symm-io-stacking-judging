# blacklisted ERC20 addresses will DOS the disabling/blacklisting of reward tokens

### Summary

Tokens like USDC have blacklisted functionality, meaning that if tokens are transfered from/to this account the transfer tx will revert.
In case such account has participated in `SymmStaking.sol ` before it got blacklisted by USDC, this will lead to permanent DOS of blacklisting reward tokens that were whitelisted before.



### Root Cause

When a reward token has to be blacklisted, almost all of the pending rewards need to be distributed to the staking participants.
`			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);`

The issue is that if a user got blacklisted from reward tokens that support blacklisting(such as USDC), `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` will always revert with `OngoingRewardPeriodForToken` error, when the admins try to disable USDC as a reward token. Leading to a permanent DOS of blacklisting already whitelisted reward tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) Users have staked tokens
2) An admin calls `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()`

### External Pre-conditions

1) an account that has staked tokens gets blacklisted from a reward token(such as USDC), after he staked in `SymStaking.sol`


### Attack Path

1) an admin whitelists USDC as a reward token
2) users stake tokens in order to get a USDC rewards
3) one of those users gets blacklisted from USDC
4) the admin calls `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` and tries to blacklist USDC
5) the disabling/blacklisting of USDC always reverts with` OngoingRewardPeriodForToken` error, because the pending rewards cannot be distributed to the blacklisted USDC address

### Impact

Permanent DOS of `SymStaking::configureRewardToken()` for disabling already enabled reward tokens
