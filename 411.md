# Lack of storage gap in upgradeable contract will corrupt storage layout for future upgrades

### Summary

Missing storage gap in upgradeable contract will cause a storage layout corruption for all users as future upgrades will overwrite existing storage slots, potentially affecting user balances, reward calculations, and access control.
[SymmStaking.sol#L143-L166](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L143-L166)


```solidity
contract SymmStaking is Initializable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable {
    // Current storage layout
    address public stakingToken;                    // slot 0
    uint256 public totalSupply;                     // slot 1
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;   // slot 2
    mapping(address => TokenRewardState) public rewardState;  // slot 3
    address[] public rewardTokens;                  // slot 4
    mapping(address => bool) public isRewardToken;  // slot 5
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public userRewardPerTokenPaid;  // slot 6
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public rewards;  // slot 7
    mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRewards;  // slot 8

    // Missing storage gap
    // uint256[50] private __gap;  // Should reserve slots 9-58 for future upgrades
}
```

### Root Cause

None

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

 The users cannot access their funds and rewards when the contract is upgraded, as the storage layout corruption will affect:
1. balanceOf mapping - Users' staked token balances become inaccessible or corrupted
2. rewards mapping - Users' earned rewards become inaccessible or corrupted
3. userRewardPerTokenPaid mapping - Users' reward calculations become incorrect

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Storage Gap and Constructor
```diff
// Mapping from user => reward token => user paid reward per token.
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public userRewardPerTokenPaid;
// Mapping from user => reward token => reward amount.
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public rewards;

// Mapping from reward token to the total pending rewards (i.e. rewards that have been notified but not yet claimed).
mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRewards;

+ uint256[50] private __gap;


+ /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
+ constructor() {
+    _disableInitializers();
+ }
