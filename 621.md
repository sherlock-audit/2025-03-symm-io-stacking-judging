# Admin will cause loss of vested funds for users

## Summary
Unchecked ERC-20 transfers in the Vesting contract will cause incorrect state updates for users, as an admin (or misconfigured system) will record successful withdrawals even when token transfers fail. This happens because the contract uses `IERC20.transfer` without verifying its return value, marking tokens as claimed while they are not actually delivered.

## Root Case
In the Vesting contract https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281, `claim...` functions update state (reducing `totalVested` and increasing `claimedAmount`) before calling `IERC20.transfer` without checking for success. If the transfer fails (for instance, with a non-compliant token), the contract still emits a success event and finalizes the claim, causing user funds to be effectively lost.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Vesting withdrawal functions update internal state before executing the token transfer.
2. The contract calls `IERC20.transfer` without using a safety mechanism like OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`.
3. No mechanism exists to revert state changes if the token transfer fails silently.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A non-standard ERC-20 token is used that returns `false` or fails silently on transfers.
2. The vesting contract’s balance is insufficient or the token’s behavior prevents a successful transfer.

## Attack Path
1. A user initiates a withdrawal by calling `claimUnlockedToken`.
2. The contract calculates the claimable amount and updates internal records as if the tokens were transferred.
3. It calls `IERC20.transfer(user, amount)`, which fails silently.
4. The function emits an event indicating success, though the user receives no tokens.
5. The internal state incorrectly shows that the user’s tokens have been claimed.

## Impact
The affected party (users) suffer a loss of vested funds because the contract’s state shows that tokens have been withdrawn while they remain in the contract. This leads to locked funds, causing financial loss and eroding user trust in the protocol.

## PoC
1. Deploy a non-standard ERC-20 token that always returns `false` on `transfer`.
2. Fund the Vesting contract with this token and set up a vesting schedule for a user.
3. The user calls `claimUnlockedToken`.
4. The contract updates its state and calls `IERC20.transfer(user, amount)`, which fails silently.
5. The transaction emits a success event, but the user receives no tokens, leaving the funds stranded in the contract.

## Mitigation
- **Integrate SafeERC20:** Replace direct calls to `IERC20.transfer` with `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` to ensure the transaction reverts on failure.
- **Add Explicit Checks:** Alternatively, check the return value of `transfer` and revert if it returns `false`.
- **Update Post-Transfer:** Optionally, update internal state only after a successful transfer to maintain consistency.
