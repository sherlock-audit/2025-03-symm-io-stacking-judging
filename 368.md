# The user will not be able to claim all his rewards

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L265-L268

A blacklisted address for a specific token in the `rewardTokens` array in the `SymmStaking` contract will cause a denial-of-service (DoS) for claiming rewards across all reward tokens. This occurs because the `SymmStaking::claimRewards()` function calls the internal `SymmStaking::_claimRewardsFor()` function, which loops over all reward tokens.

### Root Cause

The `SymmStaking` contract supports multiple reward tokens, as stated in the documentation:
> `SymmStaking` is an upgradeable, multi-token reward staking contract...

The supported tokens are:
> Only whitelisted tokens can work with the codebase, and these include stable-coins such as USDC, USDT, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM.

USDC, for example, has blacklist functionality that stops the execution of main operations (e.g., transfers).

The `claimRewards()` function:

```solidity
function claimRewards() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);
    _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);
}
```

The `_claimRewardsFor()` internal function:

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[user][token] = 0;
            pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
            emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

Letâ€™s say the configured reward tokens are USDT, USDC, and SYMM, and user X is blacklisted from the USDC token. When the user tries to claim their rewards, the `_claimRewardsFor()` function will revert on this line: `IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);`. As a result, they will not be able to claim any of their rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin needs to call the `configureRewardToken()` and `notifyRewardAmount()` functions for all reward tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. The USDC contract should blacklist user X

### Attack Path

1. User X deposits a certain amount of `stakingToken` tokens to be eligible to claim rewards.
2. Then they call the `claimRewards()` function, expecting to receive rewards for all reward tokens (assuming USDT, USDC, and SYMM are the currently configured reward tokens).
3. The function reverts because the user is blacklisted for USDC, and they receive none of the rewards for USDT or SYMM either.

### Impact

A single token blacklist (e.g., USDC) will cause a denial-of-service (DoS) for reward claiming across all reward tokens. The problematic token cannot be removed by `configureRewardToken` if there are pending rewards. Additionally, the `claimRewards()` function is time-sensitive, and according to [Sherlock's third standard](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iii.-sherlocks-standards), it qualifies as High or Medium severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of looping over all reward tokens in the `_claimRewardsFor()` function, pass the token as an argument and make separate calls for each reward token.
