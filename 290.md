# Does not set roles on the constructor in `SymmAllocationClaimer`

### Summary

The `SymmAllocationClaimer` has a few roles for access control, like:
`SETTER_ROLE`
`MINTER_ROLE`
`PAUSER_ROLE`
`UNPAUSER_ROLE`
However, it only sets on the constructor one of these roles and one role from other contract:
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and
`SETTER_ROLE`

This is a problem because after contract is deployed, for certain functions that can only be called by specific roles on the contract will be unusable due to role that can call it isn't set after deployment.
Functions like this will be unable to be called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L140

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L145

This may compromise the contract and they won't be able to call critical functions like `pause` and `unpause`.

### Root Cause

In `SymmAllocationClaimer::constructor` only two roles are being set:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L64
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L65
and other 3 roles are not being set:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L14
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L15
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L16


### Internal Pre-conditions

The `MINTER_ROLE` is required to call the `adminClaim` function.
The `PAUSER_ROLE` is required to call the `pause` function.
The `UNPAUSER_ROLE` is required to call the `unpause` function.

### External Pre-conditions

The contract is deployed without setting the necessary roles (`MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `UNPAUSER_ROLE`) in the constructor.


### Attack Path

1. Deploy the contract without setting the necessary roles in the constructor.
2. Attempt to call the `adminClaim`, `pause` or `unpause` functions.
3. The calls fail because the required roles are not set, leading to a denial of service for these functions.

### Impact

Critical functions such as `adminClaim`, `pause`, and `unpause` cannot be called, rendering the contract partially or fully inoperable.
The inability to pause or unpause the contract can lead to security risks if the contract needs to be paused in an emergency.
The inability to claim admin tokens can disrupt the intended functionality and token distribution.

### PoC

This is on foundry btw so make sure you have foundry installed by doing

```bash
foundryup
```

Create a new file in solidity in order to test this, make sure the import paths are correct too

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol";
import "../contracts/interfaces/IERC20Minter.sol";

contract SymmAllocationClaimerTest is Test {
    SymmAllocationClaimer claimer;
    address public immutable token;
    uint256 public immutable mintFactor;
    address public symmioFoundationAddress;
    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    bytes32 public constant SETTER_ROLE = keccak256("SETTER_ROLE"); // `SETTER_ROLE`: Permission to set user allocations and related parameters.
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE"); // `MINTER_ROLE`: Permission to claim admin-allocated token
    bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE"); // `PAUSER_ROLE`: Permission to pause the contract.
    bytes32 public constant UNPAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("UNPAUSER_ROLE"); // unpause

    function setUp() public {
        claimer = new SymmAllocationClaimer(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, SETTER_ROLE, token, symmioFoundationAddress, mintFactor);
       
    }
     function testCantCallFunctions() public {
        claimer.pause();
        vm.expectRevert();
        claimer.unpause();
        vm.expectRevert();
        claimer.adminClaim(1000);
        vm.expectRevert();
}
}
```

Try running this locally on a forket network

```bash
forge test --mt testCantCallFunctions -vv
```

```bash
forge test --fork-url <RPC_URL> --mt testCantCallFunctions --vv
```

### Mitigation

Change the constructor a bit to grant the roles and put the addresses as parameters
Old constructor:

```solidity
constructor(address admin, address setter, address _token, address _symmioFoundation, uint256 _mintFactor) {
		if (_token == address(0) || admin == address(0) || setter == address(0) || _symmioFoundation == address(0)) {
			revert ZeroAddress();
		}
		if (_mintFactor > 1e18 || _mintFactor == 0) {
			revert InvalidFactor();
		}

		token = _token;
		_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, setter);
		symmioFoundationAddress = _symmioFoundation;
		mintFactor = _mintFactor;

		emit SymmioFoundationAddressSet(symmioFoundationAddress);
	}
```
New constructor:

```solidity
    constructor(
        address admin,
        address setter,
        address minter,
        address pauser,
        address unpauser,
        address _token,
        address _symmioFoundation,
        uint256 _mintFactor
    ) {
        if (_token == address(0) || admin == address(0) || setter == address(0) || _symmioFoundation == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        if (_mintFactor > 1e18 || _mintFactor == 0) {
            revert InvalidFactor();
        }

        token = _token;
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, setter);
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser);
        _grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, unpauser);
        symmioFoundationAddress = _symmioFoundation;
        mintFactor = _mintFactor;

        emit SymmioFoundationAddressSet(symmioFoundationAddress);
    }
```
