# USDC-Blacklisted Users Unable to Claim Any Reward Tokens

### Summary

A single reward token transfer failure will cause a complete denial of service for users claiming rewards as blacklisted users will be unable to receive any of their earned rewards when the USDC transfer fails during the reward claim process.

[LOC](https://github.com/symm-io/stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L386)

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:374-386](https://github.com/symm-io/stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374-L386) the `_claimRewardsFor` function processes all reward tokens in a single transaction without handling potential transfer failures. The function loops through all reward tokens and transfers them one by one:

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[user][token] = 0;
            pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);  // <-- Critical issue
            emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

If a user is blacklisted by USDC (which has a blacklist functionality), the `safeTransfer` call will revert for that token, causing the entire transaction to fail. This prevents the user from claiming any rewards, even from tokens where they're not blacklisted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have staked tokens and earned rewards in multiple tokens including USDC
2. The `rewardTokens` array must include USDC and at least one other reward token
3. User must have accumulated rewards greater than 0 for multiple tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user's address must be blacklisted by the USDC token contract

### Attack Path

1. User stakes tokens and earns rewards in multiple tokens including USDC and other tokens
2. User gets blacklisted by USDC (for reasons outside the control of this protocol)
3. User calls `claimRewards()` function to claim their earned rewards
4. Inside `_claimRewardsFor`, when trying to transfer USDC to the user, the USDC contract reverts the transaction
5. The entire transaction fails, preventing the user from receiving any rewards, including those from other tokens

### Impact

Users who are blacklisted by USDC cannot claim any of their earned rewards, even from tokens where they aren't blacklisted. This creates a permanent denial of service for these users, essentially locking all their accrued rewards.

### PoC

No coded PoC is needed as the issue is evident from the contract logic. When a user is blacklisted by USDC and attempts to claim rewards, the `safeTransfer` call will revert, causing the entire transaction to fail.

### Mitigation

Let users or admin claim indivual rewards
