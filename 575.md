# USDC rewards will not be distributed if `_updateRewardsStates` is triggered too often

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L402-L423

_updateRewardsStates can be triggered as often as each block (2 seconds) via deposit/withdraw/claim/notifyRewardAmount

e.g. if there's 1209.6e6 USDC rewards for one week (604800 seconds)


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374

rate = 1209_600000 / 604800 = 2000 "usdc units" per second


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202

if SYMM total staked supply is 1_000_000e18 (~26560 usd), and we call `deposit` each block, then [`perTokenStored` will be increased by](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L412):

2 * 2000 * 1e18 / 1_000_000e18 = 4_000 / 1_000_000 = 0

Therefore, `perTokenStored` will not increase, but [`lastUpdated` will be increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L413), therefore users will not receive any USDC rewards for staking.

In this particular example, triggering `_updateRewardsStates` once in 249 blocks would be sufficient, as it would still result in rewards rounding down to zero.


### Root Cause

Lack of upscaling for tokens with less than 18 decimals for reward calculations.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls deposit/withdraw/notifyRewardAmount with any non-zero amount every block (or less often as long as the calculation will still round down to zero)

### Impact

High: stakers do not receive rewards in tokens with low decimals (e.g. USDC, USDT).

### PoC

1. SYMM total staked supply = 1_000_000e18
2. `notifyRewardAmount` is called with 1209.6 USDC
3. griefer calls `deposit/withdraw` 1 wei of SYMM each 249 blocks for 1 week
4. USDC rewards are stuck in the contract, instead of being distributed to stakers (but can be rescued by admin)

### Mitigation

Introduce 1e12 multiplier for reward calculation, and divide the accumulated rewards by 1e12 when they are being claimed.
