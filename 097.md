# Incorrect Reward Calculation in deposit

### Summary

A critical vulnerability was identified in the `SymmStaking.sol`  contract where rewards are updated before `totalSupply` is modified in the `deposit` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the reward-per-token (RPT) calculations by front-running deposits, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards. The issue arises due to the incorrect order of operations, which enables attackers to accumulate disproportionately high rewards at the expense of honest users.

### Root Cause

The issue can be found here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234-L243


```Solidity
	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(receiver); 

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
		totalSupply += amount;
		balanceOf[receiver] += amount;
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
	}
```



The `_updateRewardsStates(receiver)` function is executed before updating the `totalSupply`.

Since `rewardPerToken` is calculated as: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202


```Solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```



A lower `totalSupply` results in a higher RPT at the time of the update. An attacker can exploit this by front-running a large deposit, ensuring their reward-per-token is locked at a higher rate than honest users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Nil

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

1, Initial State:

* totalSupply = 1,000 tokens.

* rewardRate = 10 tokens per second.


2, Attacker Deposits Before Large Depositor

* Attacker deposits 1 token.

* `_updateRewardsStates(A)` calculates rewards with a low total supply.

* The `rewardPerToken` increases significantly.

3, Honest User Deposits 10,000 Tokens

* New `totalSupply` = 11,001 tokens.

* `_updateRewardsStates(B)` now calculates rewards with a much larger denominator, reducing the reward-per-token significantly.

4, Attacker Repeats Process

* Attacker can keep depositing small amounts before large deposits.

* Attacker accumulates unfairly high rewards while honest users get significantly lower rewards per token.

### Impact

* Honest stakers earn significantly fewer rewards than attackers.

* Unfair Reward Distribution

### PoC

Nil

### Mitigation

Modify the `deposit` function to update `totalSupply` before calling `_updateRewardsStates()`:

```Solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    totalSupply += amount;  // ✅ Update total supply first
    balanceOf[receiver] += amount;  // ✅ Update user balance
    
    _updateRewardsStates(receiver);  // ✅ Now update rewards with correct total supply

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
}
```
