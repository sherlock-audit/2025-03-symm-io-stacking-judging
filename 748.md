# Missing onlyInitializing Modifier in __vesting_init Function

### Summary



The __vesting_init function in the contract is designed to initialize variables and grant roles to an admin during deployment. However, the function lacks the onlyInitializing modifier, which is crucial when inheriting contracts like symmVesting.sol. Without this modifier, the initialization logic could potentially be called multiple times, leading to unintended reinitialization and overwriting of critical state variables.

### Root Cause

Root cause is in the  __vesting_init Function of the Vesting.sol contract which lacks an onlyInitializing variable

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

- attacker calls __vesting_init to re-initiate token variables this is possible because according to open zeppenlin inherited contracts should have the onlyInitializing modifier and not the intializer modifier

### Impact

Reinitialization Risk: The absence of the onlyInitializing modifier allows the function to be called multiple times. This could overwrite important state variables and roles, leading to security vulnerabilities and operational issues.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

replace onlyInitializing in _vesting_init to initializer
