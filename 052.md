# Missing Access Control in notifyRewardAmount Enables Manipulation of Reward Rates


## Summary

The `SymmStaking` contract lacks proper access control on the `notifyRewardAmount` function, allowing external users to manipulate reward rates and distribution periods. This vulnerability enables attackers to reduce rewards for legitimate users at minimal cost drastically.

## Vulnerability Details

The `notifyRewardAmount` function is intended to allow reward distributions to stakers but lacks any access control modifier:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    // ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        if (amount == 0) continue;
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```

Unlike other administrative functions in the contract that use `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)`, this function can be called by any address. The vulnerability allows an attacker to contribute minimal rewards (e.g., 1 wei), which resets the reward rate calculation in `_addRewardsForToken`:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

Key issues:

1. The function always extends the distribution period by a full duration (1 week)
2. It recalculates the rate by spreading existing rewards plus the new amount over the new period
3. When a small amount is added late in the period, the rate is drastically diluted

## POC
Add this POC to the symmStaking.behavior.ts test file.
```solidity
describe.only("Security Issues - Access Control", function () {
    it("PoC: Any user can manipulate reward rates and impact staking rewards", async function () {

        await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(userDepositAmount, user1.address)

User earnings REDUCED by 85.80% per hour!

--- ATTACK COST VS DAMAGE ANALYSIS ---
Cost to attacker: 1 tokens
Original rewards remaining: 86400000 tokens
New rewards remaining (due to attack): 12268800 tokens
Total reward reduction: 74131200 tokens
Damage ratio: 74131200.00x (every 1 token spent by attacker reduces rewards by 74131200.00 tokens)
## Impact

1. **Reward Manipulation**: Attackers can repeatedly reset reward rates with minimal cost (1 token per transaction).

2. **Denial of Service**: By continuously extending the reward period, legitimate rewards never fully distribute, creating a persistent denial of service.

3. **Trust Damage**: Users observing unexpectedly low rewards may lose confidence in the platform and withdraw their stake, negatively affecting protocol TVL and reputation.

## Tools Used

 Manual code review


## Recommendations

1. **Add Access Control Modifier**:
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {  // Add this line
    // Existing code...
}
```
