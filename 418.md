# Dilution of rewards given that an attacker sends 1 wei every block

### Summary

A common attack vector in such functions which update the duration on notifying a reward is an attacker sending a sum such as 1 wei (neglible amount) of reward token so that he updates the duration and the reward per rate of second every single time and given that he does it a lot, he will dilute the rate of reward token per second so much that the user will get 20-30% less tokens for the duration than expected.

### Root Cause

The root cause would be that the `notifyReward()` is permissionless, as well as no minimum amount exists, which is a direct cause of the finding as well.

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) is the function and the logic that is responsible for the exploit

### Internal Pre-conditions

User spams 1 wei every block (it is on BASE as well, so gas will be extremely cheap), to dilute the reward per token per sec

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User makes a bot to send 1 wei of reward token every block to `notifyRewardAmount()`, so that he dilutes the rewards over time and causes users to claim less than they would be entitled

### Impact

Legitimate users will get much less than they are entitled to due to the user diluting the reward rate per sec

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make a minimum amount validation for the token so that users can't send such amounts like 1 wei
