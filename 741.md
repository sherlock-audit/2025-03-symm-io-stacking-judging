# Missing onlyInitializing Modifier in __vesting_init Function

Summary 

The __vesting_init function in the contract is designed to initialize variables and grant roles to an admin during deployment. However, the function lacks the onlyInitializing modifier, which is crucial when inheriting contracts like symmVesting.sol. Without this modifier, the initialization logic could potentially be called multiple times, leading to unintended reinitialization and overwriting of critical state variables.

Impact

Reinitialization Risk: The absence of the onlyInitializing modifier allows the function to be called multiple times. This could overwrite important state variables and roles, leading to security vulnerabilities and operational issues.

Mitigation: To resolve this issue, the onlyInitializing modifier should be added to ensure that the function can only be called during the initialization phase of the contract. Below is the updated code:
