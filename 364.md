# Expired Vesting Plans Cannot Be Reset or Recreated Due to Restrictive Checks

### Summary

The contract restricts resetting and creating new vesting plans in a way that makes it impossible to reassign vesting once a plan expires.

In resetAmount():
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L76
Blocks resetting expired vesting plans.

In setup():
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L58
Blocks setting up a new plan for users who had a previous vesting plan.

This results in a permanent lockout, preventing users from receiving any new vesting allocations once their previous plan ends.

### Root Cause

resetAmount() Does Not Allow Resetting Expired Plans

The check if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished(); prevents resetting a vesting plan once the vesting period has expired.
This means users with expired vesting plans can never be reassigned a new vesting plan using resetAmount().


setup() Prevents Creating a New Vesting Plan If One Already Exists

The check if (isSetup(self)) revert AlreadySetup(); prevents setting up a new vesting plan if one was already set in the past.
Even if the previous vesting plan has expired, the contract still considers it "setup", blocking a new plan.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user must already have an expired vesting plan.
The admin must attempt to reset or create a new vesting plan for the user.

### External Pre-conditions

The admin or an authorized role tries to allocate a new vesting plan to a user whose previous plan has expired.
The transaction fails due to the restrictive checks.

### Attack Path

- User has a vesting plan for 100 tokens that ended on January 1, 2025.
- Admin tries to reset the plan with _resetVestingPlans(token, [user], [50]).
- Transaction fails because PlanIsFinished() is triggered (remaining == 0).
- Admin then tries to create a new plan with setupVestingPlans().
- Transaction fails because AlreadySetup() is triggered (isSetup(self) == true).
- User is permanently locked out of new vesting plans unless the contract is modified.

### Impact

Users with expired vesting plans can never receive new allocations.
Admins cannot reset or assign new vesting schedules after an initial plan expires.
The only way to fix this is a contract upgrade or redeployment, which is inefficient.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify isSetup() Function

Before
```solidity
function isSetup(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (bool) {
		return self.amount != 0;
	}
```

After
```solidity
function isSetup(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (bool) {
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
		return self.amount != 0 && remaining != 0;
	}
```

And need to call _claimUnlockedToken() before calling _setupVestingPlans().
