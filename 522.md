# Incorrect Permit2 Deadline Implementation Causes Immediate Approval Expiry

### Summary

Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline in Permit2 approvals causes the approvals to expire in the same block they are created, potentially leading to failed transactions and denial of service.

### Root Cause

In line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L187C3-L189C1 `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` Permit2 approvals are created with current timestamp as deadline:

``PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));  // Expires immediately
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));  // Expires immediately``




### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

- Network congestion causing delayed inclusion
- Transaction Queue Scenarios

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

1 .Transaction failures due to expired approvals
2. Potential DoS during network congestion
3. Wasted gas from failed transactions

### PoC

1. User calls addLiquidity with 1000 SYMM
2. Transaction gets timestamp T
3. Permit2 approvals set with deadline T
4. If transaction processes at T+1
5. Approvals are already expired
6. Transaction reverts

### Mitigation

Add a reasonable buffer time to the deadline:

`// Add constant for deadline buffer
uint256 private constant PERMIT_DEADLINE_BUFFER = 1 hours;

function _addLiquidity(...) internal returns (...) {
    // ...existing code...
    
    uint48 deadline = uint48(block.timestamp + PERMIT_DEADLINE_BUFFER);
    
    PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), deadline);
    PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), deadline);
    
    // ...existing code...
}`
