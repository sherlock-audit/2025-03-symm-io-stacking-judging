# `block.timestamp` used as deadline in `PERMIT2.approve`


## Summary

The deadline parameter passed in PERMIT2.approve is set as `block.timestamp`, resulting delayed transactions to be executed unexpectedly.

## Root Cause
`block.timestamp` is passed in the PERMIT2.approve function:

## Vulnerability Details

Currently, PERMIT2.approve uses block.timestamp as the deadline when adding liquidity for SYMMLP Balancer tokens.

This is risky during Base L2 congestion, as the approval may execute under unfavorable conditions without real protection. Additionally, the user's slippage settings may become outdated.

## Root Cause
No buffer added to block.timestamp when passing deadline parameter into PERMIT2.approve.

## Impact 
Outdated slippage may lead to users adding liquidity under unfavorable and unexpected conditions.

## Mitigation

Allow users to set a custom deadline instead of relying on block.timestamp for proper approval expiration.
