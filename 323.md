# Early Claiming of The Tokens

### Summary
Users can claim the tokens earlier than intended due to a flaw in the `resetAmount` function.

### Root Cause
The `resetAmount` function incorrectly sets the `startTime` to the current time (block.timestamp) even if the current time has not yet reached the original `startTime`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L77
```solidity
	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
		self.startTime = block.timestamp;
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
		self.amount = amount;
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}
```

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L23
```solidity
	function unlockedAmount(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
		if (currentTime >= self.endTime) return self.amount;
23:		if (currentTime <= self.startTime) return 0;
		uint256 duration = self.endTime - self.startTime;
		uint256 elapsed = currentTime - self.startTime;
		return (self.amount * elapsed) / duration;
	}
```
As we can see in the above code, the protocol considers the case where `currentTime` is less than `startTime`.

Consider the following scenario:
Alice's Vesting Plan:
  - currentTime: 1st January
  - startTime: 1st February
  - endTime: 1st August
  - amount: 42,000 tokens
1. Alice calls the `claimLockedToken` function with a minimum amount (e.g., 0).
2. The vesting position is reset, resulting in:
  - startTime: 1st January
  - endTime: 1st August
3. On 1st February, Alice can claim 6,000 tokens, even though she should not be able to claim anything yet.

### Impact
This vulnerability allows users to claim the tokens earlier than they should.

### Mitigation
Consider setting the `startTime` to the maximum of the current time and the original `startTime`.
