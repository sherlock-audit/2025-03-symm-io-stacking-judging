# Vesting::_resetVestingPlans reverts in legitimate cases

### Summary

When a user adds liquidity to Balancer using `SymmVesting::_addLiquidityProcess`, the contract claims all pending vesting before modifying the amount of locked vesting (increasing LP vesting and reducing Symm vesting). However, **there is a restriction that prevents the user from performing this action freely**.

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```

For example, in the following scenario, a user would be unable to provide liquidity to Balancer:

* vesting.Amount = 100  

* vesting.unlocked() = 20  

* vesting.locked() = 80  

The user intends to add the entire locked amount (80) as liquidity to Balancer.

When the following line is executed:

```solidity
symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);
```

The expected result is a value close to 0.

Eventually, this triggers:

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```

This causes a revert because 0 < 20.

### Attack Path

*No Response*

### Impact

* Users would be unable to add liquidity in most cases.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the restriction `amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()`, as resetAmount already ensures the vesting is properly adjusted internally.
