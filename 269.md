# `SymmStaking::rewardPerToken()` lacks precision and will lead to no rewards for users

### Summary

[SymmStaking::rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194) stores `rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored` with a precision of `1e18`. However, this is not enough whenever the reward token is for example USDT with 6 decimals and the staking token is $SYMM which has 18 decimals. This will lead to 0 or very rounded down rewards per block, which can be called every block to stop distributions to users.

### Root Cause

In `StakingRewards:200`, the `1e18` precision is not enough.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Staking token has more decimals or has a much lower price than the reward token.

### Attack Path

1. Reward is added with `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate < totalSupply / (blockTime * 1e18)`.
2. Attacker calls `StakingReward::deposit()` each block or similar function to update the rewards each block adding 0 rewards each time.

### Impact

Staking contract distributes 0 rewards.

### PoC

1. Reward token is $USDT and the rate is given by the amount divided by the duration. Suppose `100_000e6` $USDT for 1 week.
2. Block time is 2 seconds on base.
3. Staking token is $SYMM. Suppose `1_000_000e18` $SYMM.
Thus, updating rewards each block yields `rewardPerToken = 2 * 100_000e6 / (7*24*3600) * 1e18 / 1_000_000e18 = 0`.

### Mitigation

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * decimalsDiff * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```
