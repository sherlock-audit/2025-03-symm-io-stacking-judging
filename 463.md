# Anyone could call `notifyRewardAmount` to extend the period finish time

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function allows anyone to extend the reward period finish time by calling the function with a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei). 

### Root Cause

The function `notifyRewardAmount` can be called by anyone with negligible amount, allowing it to be exploited to extend the reward finish time at little cost.
This could result in loss of rewards; for instance, if there are 10 USDC rewards within a 10-day period, a malicious user could extend the finish time on day 5, extending the finish time to the 15th day. Participants would only receive 7.5 USDC by the 10th day.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract allows anyone to call `notifyRewardAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

The contract must have an ongoing rewards distribution.

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei or 0 tokens).
2. The function updates the reward period finish to `block.timestamp + state.duration`, extending the time frame.
3. This extension lowers the effective reward rate by spreading existing rewards over a longer period.
4. The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely, preventing rewards from being distributed at the expected rate

### Impact

Anyonce could extend the reward finish time and the users may receive less rewards than expected during the same time period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only specific users to call `notifyRewardAmount` function
