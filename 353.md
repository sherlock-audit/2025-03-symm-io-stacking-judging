# Public resetAmount() Function in Library Allows Unauthorized Vesting Plan modify

### Summary

The resetAmount() function in the VestingPlanOps library is public, which means any contract that imports this library can call it. This allows unauthorized actors to arbitrarily modify vesting plans, potentially leading to:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71
- Modifying new vesting schedules for accounts they do not control.
- Locking or stealing funds by modifying vesting terms.

This vulnerability breaks access control and can result in unauthorized modifications of token distributions.

### Root Cause

resetAmount() is Public in the Library:
Since it's public, any contract that imports VestingPlanOps can call resetAmount(), modifying vesting plans without permission.


### Internal Pre-conditions

NONE

### External Pre-conditions

NONE

### Attack Path

Attacker deploys a contract that imports VestingPlanOps.
Attacker calls resetAmount().

### Impact

Unauthorized modifying of vesting plans.
Attackers could lock tokens permanently or steal vesting allocations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change resetAmount() from public to internal
Before:
`function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {`
After:
`function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) internal returns (VestingPlan storage) {`
