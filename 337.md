# Blacklisted Users in USDC Cannot Claim Any Rewards

## Summary
If a user is blacklisted in USDC, they will be unable to claim any rewards, even if they are eligible for other reward tokens. This happens because the claimRewards() function iterates over all reward tokens and if any token transfer fails (e.g., USDC due to blacklisting), the entire transaction reverts, preventing the user from claiming any rewards.

## Root Cause
The claimRewards() function does not handle per-token transfer failures gracefully.
If any IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount) fails, the entire function call reverts.

## Attack Path
- A user stakes tokens and accrues rewards in multiple tokens.
- The user tries to call claimRewards().
- The contract attempts to transfer USDC first but fails due to blacklisting.
- The entire transaction reverts, and the user is unable to claim any rewards, even those unrelated to USDC.

## Impact
Denial of rewards: Affected users cannot claim any rewards due to a single failing token transfer.
Usability issue: Users who are blacklisted in one token (e.g., USDC) are unfairly prevented from accessing rewards in other tokens.
Potential loss of user funds: If users cannot withdraw rewards, they may lose access to earned incentives.

## Mitigation
Selective claiming: Introduce a claimSpecificRewards(address[] calldata tokens) function to let users claim specific tokens instead of all at once.
