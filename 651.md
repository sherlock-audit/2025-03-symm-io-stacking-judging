# SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote will not handle balances properly whenever Balancer v3 Pool is in recovery mode

### Summary

Balancer v3 pools have a recovery mode designed to protect LPs in emergency situations. Governance can activate this mode at any time if needed.
The problem arises in the SymmVesting contract because there is no proper mechanism to handle this situation.

As per the docs of the balancer pool
```solidity 
 * @dev Note that live balances will not necessarily be accurate if the pool is in Recovery Mode.
     * Withdrawals in Recovery Mode do not make external calls (including those necessary for updating live balances),
     * so if there are withdrawals, raw and live balances will be out of sync until Recovery Mode is disabled.
     *
```
As a result, balances will not be properly synchronized when the pool is in recovery mode. This could allow malicious users to exploit the situation by adding liquidity at a discount.

### Root Cause

SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote() doesn't handle Balancer v3 pool recovery mode properly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Balancer v3 pool should get into recovery mode due to an emergency situation.

### Attack Path

1. Balancer v3 pool is put in recovery mode
2. Malicious user initiates transactions with addLiquidity() as balances will not be synced as per the docs
3. Malicious user gains inflated amount of LP tokens

### Impact

Malicious user gains LP tokens at a discount from the balancer v3 pool

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks for recovery mode or implement a pause for the protocol whenever this mode is enabled.
