# Incorrect check will DOS adding liquidity for balancer pool from locked SYMM amounts

### Summary

During Add liquidity, we try to add SYMM LP tokens to the vesting of the User.

However, there is an edge case where because of an incorrect require statement, the add liquidity function is DOSed for the User. 

This happens because of a check where we revert if the User has claimed more than the amount set to reset. However the check is wrong as the check compares unlocked amount instead of locked amount there by reverting the transaction where user tries to add liquidity but his unlockedAmount() is greater than the amount set to reset.



### Root Cause

In Vesting.sol we see that the amount to be set, if its lesser than the unlocked amount already, its reverted!

In SymmVesting.sol, we see that the amount is only ensured that it's greater than the **lockedAmount** by a certain amount

### Attack Path

1. Let's say, user has an existing SYMM_LP vesting left for 5 days, where he claimed 80% already.
2. Out of 1000 LP tokens, he has already claimed 800 LP tokens.
3. He has a SYMM vesting for 10,000 amounts where 5,000 is locked.
4. He calls `addLiquidity` for 2,500 amount.
5. SYMM tokens are added to balancer pool and he gets 300 LP tokens
6. `amounts[0] = lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount;`
7. `_resetVestingPlans` is done for amount ~ 200 LP tokens +  300 LP tokens
8. `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();`
9. if condition compares 500 LP tokens with 800 LP tokens, and reverts DOSing the `addLiquidity` function
10. If the comparison was done for locked amount and reset amount, it would not revert as 500 LP tokens > 200 LP

### Impact

The User cannot add liquidity with his SYMM tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change or remove the require statement that says amount to set has to be bigger than the `unlockedAmount()`
