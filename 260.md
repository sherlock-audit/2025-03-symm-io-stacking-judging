# SYMM LP Vesting tokens can be claimed much faster

### Summary

The Symm vestings starts from start time and completes its vesting by end time.

The Symm LP vestings does something similar as well.

There is a bug where the LP vestings can be claimed instantly/very fastly because of a difference in the vesting schedules of the SYMM token and the SYMM LP token.

The procured lp tokens are put in the vesting schedule of the SYMM LP token if there is already a lp vesting plan setup ~ `lpVestingPlan.isSetup()`

If the Vesting schedule of the SYMM LP is nearing its end where the SYMM token's vesting is just starting.
Using the `addLiquidity` function, the locked balance can be converted to balancer lp tokens and withdrawn immediately.


### Root Cause

We can see that in `_resetVestingPlans` the vesting duration of the existing SYMM_LP is taken, which means in the event of SYMM_LP vesting finishing faster, the locked balance can be made liquid at a rate it was not meant to be

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.

### External Pre-conditions

1.

### Attack Path

1. SYMM vesting duration is 5- 10 days
2. SYMM LP vesting duration is 1- 6 days
3. `addLiquidity` is done and vested SYMM is converted to balancer lp
4. SYMM LP vesting amount is incremented with new balancer lp
5. day 6 is reached and balancer lp is redeemed fully
6. This is liquid faster compared to someone whose SYMM and SYMM LP Vesting duration is both 5 - 10 days

### Impact

The locked vested tokens are released at unintended rate
