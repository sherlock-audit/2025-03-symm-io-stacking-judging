# Removal of `rewardToken` via `configureRewardToken()` can be blocked

## Summary: 
Malicious user can frontrun and add DUST amount to `pendingRewards` via `notifyRewardAmount()`  to prevent REWARD_MANAGER from removing a rewardToken from whitelist via `configureRewardToken()`

## Description: 
In order to whitelist a new token and add it into rewardTokens array, it can be done via `configureRewardToken()`. 
We can enable/disable status of a token using this function. However, there lies an issue here. 

[#configureRewardToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312-L326)

In order to remove a token from the list of reward tokens, there is a condition which validates that if `(pendingRewards[token] > 10)` then it will revert. 
This is done so that users can claim their pending rewards. 

However, a malicious user can increase this mapping value via  `notifyRewardAmount()` i.e. [#notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L288) adding dust amount, and  prevent the owner from removing the token from whitelist. 
This can be done for all the reward tokens, which will break the functionality of `configureRewardToken()` as the owner will be unable to remove the reward tokens. 

## Recommendation: 
Consider increasing this `pendingReward` limit so that malicious users are discouraged from doing so.
