# Any use can extend the state.periodFinish

### Summary

In the function SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken, which can be called by any user, the periodFinish of the state is extended by the current time plus the state's duration. This means that a user can keep extending periodFinish indefinitely, preventing the rewards from ever being fully distributed. 

### Root Cause

This happens because _addRewardsForToken updates periodFinish to block.timestamp + state.duration without any restrictions, meaning users can keep calling this function to extend the period indefinitely. [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user (any role) needs to call notifyRewardAmount() to deposit reward tokens and trigger _addRewardsForToken().
2. The function _addRewardsForToken() needs to set state.periodFinish to be at least block.timestamp + state.duration every time it's called.
3. The function can be called repeatedly, allowing periodFinish to go from a near-future timestamp to an indefinite future timestamp with each call.
4. There is no check preventing periodFinish from being extended beyond a reasonable limit, allowing rewards to remain pending indefinitely.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have access to a reward token that is whitelisted in the contract. (They can deposit a very small amount (e.g., 1 wei) just to trigger the issue.)
2. The attacker must have enough balance of the reward token to repeatedly call notifyRewardAmount() and extend periodFinish.
3. The staking contract must remain active (i.e., not paused by an admin).

### Attack Path

1. Admin initializes a special reward distribution. For example, they set up a 1-week reward distribution.
2. An attacker calls SymmStacking::notifyRewardAmount(he provides a small amount of tokens (e.g., 1 wei) to trigger SymmStacking::_addRewardsForToken.)
3. By repeatedly calling the function, the attacker keeps extending periodFinish, delaying the distribution of rewards.
4. Depositors expecting rewards will receive them at a significantly slower rate, potentially indefinitely.


### Impact

Depositors may never receive their full rewards, as the reward distribution period can be extended indefinitely. While the attacker doesn't gain direct financial profit, they can grief depositors by preventing them from receiving their rewards.
