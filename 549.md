# Reward Token Configuration Denial of Service via Reward Injection

### Summary

The [`configureRewardToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L331) function in the `SymmStaking` contract contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to prevent the removal of a reward token by injecting a small amount of rewards. Since `notifyRewardAmount` has no access controls, anyone can add rewards to prevent the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` from removing tokens, leading to contract bloat and potential gas limit issues.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the `configureRewardToken` function which prevents removing a token if it has more than 10 units of pending rewards:
```javascript
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));

    if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

    isRewardToken[token] = status;
    if (!status) {
        if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
        // ... removal logic ...
    } else {
        // ... addition logic ...
    }

    emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
}
```
This check is intended to prevent removing tokens that are actively being used for rewards. However, combined with the lack of access control on `notifyRewardAmount,` it creates an attack vector.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin wants to remove a reward token

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker keeps sending rewards to the token

### Attack Path

1. The protocol has a list of allowed reward tokens, managed by admins with the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE
2. An attacker identifies a token they want to keep in the rewards system (e.g., a low-quality token they hold)
3. When they observe the admin might want to remove this token, they execute:

- Obtain a small amount of the target token (just over 10 units)
- Call `notifyRewardAmount` with this token and amount
- This increases pendingRewards[token] above the threshold of 10


4. Now when an admin attempts to call configureRewardToken(token, false):

- The check if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) evaluates to true
- The function reverts with OngoingRewardPeriodForToken


5. The attacker can repeat this process whenever rewards are close to falling below the threshold
6. Due to the reward distribution mechanism extending periods, even a small amount can block removal for an extended time

### Impact

Dos of protocol function,  tokens that has a vulnerability and is no longer aligned with the protocol's objectives goals cannot be removed. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to `notifyRewardAmount`
