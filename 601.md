# Accrued dust amounts could block removal of reward tokens from whitelist

### Summary

Due to integer truncation and rounding errors, 
Small amounts of continuously dust accumulates in `pendingRewards ` due to various user interactions.

In this case, 
imposing a strict condition in  `configureRewardToken`  

```solidity
(pendingRewards[token] > 10)    // 10 wei threshold is way too less
revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

restricts the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE 
from removing a reward token from the whitelist.

### Root Cause

1. Solidity integer truncation 
2. Strict condition of `(pendingRewards[token] > 10)`  in  `configureRewardToken`

### Internal Pre-conditions

User interaction leaves dust amounts in the `pendingRewards` mapping due to solidity integer truncation 

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Contract : `SymmStaking`

Functions : `configureRewardToken `, `rescueTokens`

`mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRewards`

pendingRewards is modified by following external functions 

- incremented when `notifyRewardAmount ` is called
- and decremented when rewards are claimed thru `claimRewards ` or `claimFor`


_Step 1: Admin Notifies Rewards_
Admin notifies 1000 REW1 over 1 week (rate = 1000 / 604,800 ≈ 0.00165 REW1/sec).

pendingRewards[REW1] = 1000 * 1e18 wei

_Step_ 2: 
Alice stakes 100 SYMM and claims rewards after 1 week.

Rewards Earned:

100 SYMM * 0.0016534... REW1/sec * 604,800 sec ≈ 999,999,999,999,999,999 wei 
(due to truncation).

Dust Left: pendingRewards[REW1] = 1 wei.

Such dust accumulates over time due to several user interactions

In this scenario when the ADMIN wants to remove thereward token from the whitelist
the following strict condition restricts the ADMIN from doing so

```solidity
(pendingRewards[token] > 10) 
revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Impact

Reward tokens cannot be removed using `configureRewardToken`  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Mitigation Strategies:

1. Use fixed-point math to minimize truncation errors.

2. Relax the threshold in the condition , for example,

```solidity
pendingRewards[token] > 1e18 wei)
revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

3. Modify the `rescueTokens ` function to update `pendingRewards[token]` mapping

``` solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) 
    external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(receiver != address(0), "Invalid receiver");

    // Check if the token is previously whitelisted
    if (isRewardToken[token]) {
        // Ensure we don't underflow pendingRewards
        if (pendingRewards[token] >= amount) {
            pendingRewards[token] -= amount; // Decrement pendingRewards
        } else {
            // If pendingRewards is less than amount, set it to 0
            pendingRewards[token] = 0;
        }
    }

    // Transfer the tokens to the receiver
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```
