# The rewards distribution system in SymmStaking could be disturbed due to missing precision factor.

## Summary
The `state.rate` is calculated as rewards amount / duration. However, the calculation of the `state.rate` is missing precision factor and this makes it possible for attacker to disturb rewards distribution for stakers.

## Root Cause

In the [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) `_addRewardsForToken()` function, it calculates the `state.rate` as `(amount + leftover) / state.duration`. We can check the the calculation of the rate doesn't use any precision factor.

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
	@>		state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

The `state.rate` is used to the calcultion of `rewardPerToken` as following. It first calculates the rewards to be distributed until current time as `time * rate`, then divides it by `totalSupply`. The issue arises from the calculation of rewards to be distributed for certain period. Since, `state.rate` doesn't use any precision factor, less rewards will distributed to users.

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
	@>		(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}   emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
```

The fewer decimal reward token uses, the lose of rewards among users will be larger. Let's consider following scenario where reward token is USDC(decimal is 6).

Total reward is 1000 usdc and reward duration is 7 weeks(604800).

- Initial `state.rate` = 1000e6 / 604800 = 1653, amount of lose due to missing precision = 1000e6 - 604800 * 1653 = 265600
- Attackers invokes `configureRewardToken(address(USDC), 1)` for every block to update `state.rate`. Each block on Base is generated every 3 seconds.
    - After 3 second, new `state.rate` = (1653 * (604800 - 3) + 1) / 604800 = 1652, total amount of lose due to missing precision = 265600 +  599842 = 865442.
    - ...
    - After 100 iteration, new `state.rate` = 1554, total amount of lose due to missing precision = 59664511.

For each iteration, `state.rate` is reduced by 1. Also the transaction fee is very low on Base and cost for attack is small. Therefore, attacker can makes `state.rate` as 0 for an hour and this will disturb rewards distibution among stakers.

## Attack Path

Total reward is 1000 usdc and reward duration is 7 weeks(604800).

- Initial `state.rate` = 1000e6 / 604800 = 1653, amount of lose due to missing precision = 1000e6 - 604800 * 1653 = 265600
- Attackers invokes `configureRewardToken(address(USDC), 1)` for every block to update `state.rate`. Each block on Base is generated every 3 seconds.
    - After 3 second, new `state.rate` = (1653 * (604800 - 3) + 1) / 604800 = 1652, total amount of lose due to missing precision = 265600 +  599842 = 865442.
    - ...
    - After 100 iteration, new `state.rate` = 1554, total amount of lose due to missing precision = 59664511.

For each iteration, `state.rate` is reduced by 1. Also the transaction fee is very low on Base and cost for attack is small. Therefore, attacker can makes `state.rate` as 0 for an hour and this will disturb rewards distibution among stakers.

There is `rescueTokens()` in SymmStaking which transfers certain amount of token to reciver, but the rewards distribution system can be diluted by attacker continously and so this issue should be valid issue.

## Impact
Rewards distribution system among stakers will be broken.

## Mitigation

1. Implement a precision factor for the calculation of `state.rate`.

```diff
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
-			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
+			state.rate = (amount + leftover) * 1e8 / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

```diff
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
-				totalSupply);
+				totalSupply / 1e8);
	}   emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
```

2. Add minAmount check for the `_addRewardsForToken` to make attacker costs much.

```diff
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

+       require(amount >= minAmount);
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
