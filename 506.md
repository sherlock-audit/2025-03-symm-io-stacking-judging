# A blacklisted user will be unable to claim rewards

## Summary
The inability to claim rewards in `SymmStaking.sol` will cause a denial of service for stakers as they will be unable to withdraw any rewards if they are blacklisted for one of the reward tokens.

## Root Cause
In `StakiSymmStakingng.sol`, the `_claimRewardsFor()` function loops through all reward tokens and transfers them to the user. If the user is blacklisted for a particular token (e.g., USDC), the transaction will revert due to `safeTransfer()`, preventing the user from claiming any rewards.

```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward); //audit
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The admin defines multiple reward tokens, including at least one that supports blacklisting (e.g., USDC).
2. The user earns staking rewards across all defined reward tokens.
3. The user is blacklisted for one of the reward tokens.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The reward token (e.g., USDC) enforces blacklisting, preventing transfers to certain addresses.
2. A user is blacklisted by the stablecoin issuer (e.g., Circle for USDC).

## Attack Path
1. The staker calls `claimRewards()` to withdraw earned rewards.
2. The `_claimRewardsFor()` function iterates over all reward tokens and calls `safeTransfer()` for each.
3. If the staker is blacklisted for one of the tokens (e.g., USDC), the transaction reverts.
4. Since all reward transfers occur in a single loop, the user cannot withdraw any rewards, even from non-blacklisted tokens.

## Impact
The staker suffers a complete loss of access to all earned rewards due to being blacklisted for one token, which prevents the claim process from completing.

## Mitigation
1. Allow users to claim rewards for specific tokens instead of requiring all tokens to be claimed at once.
