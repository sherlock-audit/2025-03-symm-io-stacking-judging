# Users Can Spend More USDC Than Expected bypassing the protocol's intention of allowing users set the max usdc they can spend when adding liquidity

### Summary

In the `addLiquidity` function of the `SymmVesting` contract, users still spend more than intended. Specifically, if `maxUsdcIn` is set to zero, the function bypasses the spending cap, allowing users to unknowingly spend more USDC than expected when adding liquidity. This can result in financial losses due to price fluctuations and slippage in the liquidity pool.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L99C1-L105C3



In `SymmVesting.sol`, the `maxUsdcIn` parameter is intended to limit the maximum USDC a user spends. However, if set to zero, the contract does not impose any upper bound on USDC spending:

```solidity
if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
```

Since `maxUsdcIn = 0` disables this check, the transaction proceeds regardless of the actual USDC required, leading to potential overspending.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user calls `addLiquidity()` with `maxUsdcIn = 0`.
2. The required `usdcIn` for liquidity addition fluctuates due to pool conditions.
3. The transaction does not revert due to `maxUsdcIn` constraints.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The price of SYMM relative to USDC changes significantly.
2. Liquidity conditions in the pool vary, affecting `usdcIn` calculations.

### Attack Path

1. User calls addLiquidity(100e18, 500, 0) intending to add 100 SYMM, expecting at least 500 LP tokens, and mistakenly setting maxUsdcIn = 0 thinking it limits USDC spending to zero.

2. Contract calculates usdcIn = 1000e6 based on the current SYMM/USDC pool ratio (e.g., a price spike in SYMM).

3. Contract executes usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1000e6) pulling 1000 USDC from the user’s wallet, approved earlier via ERC20 approve.

4. Router adds liquidity, returning lpAmount (e.g., 600 LP tokens), which meets minLpAmountWithSlippage (e.g., 500 or default 1% of expected).

### Impact

Users suffer an approximate loss of excess USDC beyond their intended spend. The funds aren’t lost entirely, they’re converted to LP tokens, but the unexpectedly high USDC cost bypasses the protocol intention to always spend less than the maxUsdcIn set by the user



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a Minimum `maxUsdcIn`: Modify `_addLiquidity` to require a non-zero `maxUsdcIn`
```solidity
if (maxUsdcIn == 0) revert InvalidMaxUsdcIn();
if (usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
```
