# `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` calls `POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();` which rounds down instead of up

### Summary

`SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` [calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247) `POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();`, rounding down the balances, which will overestimate the `lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;`, as `symmBalance` will be smaller and thus the lp amount higher for the same `symmAmount`.
