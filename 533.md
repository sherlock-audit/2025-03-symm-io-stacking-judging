# getLiquidityQuote() use totalSupply() for calculating the USDC required and LP tokens that will be minted

### Summary

`getLiquidityQuote()` use `totalSupply()` for calculating the `USDC` required and LP tokens that will be minted which can lead to wrong results.

Based on Balancer [docs](https://github.com/balancer/docs/blob/main/docs/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.md), there are 3 way to get total supply for BPT token :

> **`getActualSupply`**
This is the most common/current function to call. `getActualSupply` is used by the most recent versions of Weighted and Stable Pools. It accounts for pre-minted BPT as well as due protocol fees.
**`getVirtualSupply`**
This is used by Linear Pools and "legacy" Stable Phantom Pools.
**`totalSupply`**
In general, `totalSupply` only makes sense to call for older "legacy" pools.
> 

The problem arises due to the use of `totalSupply()` instead of `getActualSupply()`. `totalSupply()` is used for older stable and weighted pools that do not have pre-minted BPT while `getActualSupply()` is used for newer weighted pools such as `Symm/USDC` pools that will be created by Symmio teams.

### Root Cause

*In [SymmVesting.sol:249](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L249) use `totalSupply()` instead of `getActualSupply()`*

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

Impact is HIGH one because the calculation results for USDC required and LP tokens that will be minted can be wrong and even adding liquidity continues to revert because slippage is not achieved

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change `totalSupply()` with `getActualSupply()`
