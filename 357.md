# The Max USDC Safety Check can be Unintentionally Bypassed in the `addLiquidity` Function

### Summary

When a user calls `addLiquidity`, they can specify a maximum USDC limit (`maxUsdcIn`) to control the USDC spent during liquidity addition. However, if the user sets `maxUsdcIn` to `0`, the check is effectively disabled, causing the function to ignore any intended USDC cap. This can lead to using more USDC than the user intended.

### Root Cause

The check in `_addLiquidity` is written as [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L175):

```solidity
if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
```

Because `maxUsdcIn > 0` evaluates to false when `maxUsdcIn` is `0`, the entire condition is skipped.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user calls `addLiquidity` with `maxUsdcIn` set to `0`
2. The liquidity addition function calculates a `usdcIn` value (based on pool balances) that is higher than what the user would normally expect.
3. The contract does not enforce any cap when `maxUsdcIn` equals `0`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The pool pricing mechanism determines a high `usdcIn` relative to the SYMM amount.

### Attack Path

1. The user intends to restrict the USDC spending and should set a nonzero `maxUsdcIn` (e.g., 50 USDC).
2. Instead, the user mistakenly sets `maxUsdcIn = 0`.
3. The `addLiquidity` function calculates `usdcIn` (e.g., 200 USDC) and the safety check is skipped.
4. The transaction proceeds, spending 200 USDC, far exceeding the user's intended limit.

### Impact

This bug can cause users to unintentionally spend much more USDC than expected, leading to potential financial loss. The impact is straightforward: the safety check meant to protect against overspending is disabled when `maxUsdcIn` is 0.

### PoC

A similar scenario has been set up using the remix IDE to demonstrate the validity of this bug where the safety check is bypassed.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Test {
    error MaxUsdcExceeded();

    uint256 public number;

    function call(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 maxUsdcIn) public {
        if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
        number = number + usdcIn;
    }

}
```

This contract proves that if `maxUsdcIn` is set to `0` the function skips the safety check and goes ahead to update the `number` variable with whatever was passed as `usdcIn`

### Mitigation

Enforce that `maxUsdcIn` must be greater than `0` when calling `addLiquidity()`. If a user provides `0`, revert with an appropriate error message.
