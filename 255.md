# MISSING STORAGE GAP IN SYMM STAKING CONTRACT

### Summary

The lack of a storage gap can result in storage collisions, potentially causing unintended overwriting of variables and impacting upgradeability, despite being designed to implement the Transparent Upgradeable Proxy pattern, there is no use of it.

### Root Cause

In the **SymmStaking.sol** contract, no storage gap variable is  declared.  



### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract inherits from `Initializable`

### External Pre-conditions

Upgrade protocol to v2.

### Attack Path

*

### Impact

For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add the storage gap 
```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
