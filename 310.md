# Snapshot-Based Reward Timing Exploits

## Summary
Users can manipulate deposit/withdrawal timing to claim rewards disproportionately due to delayed state updates in `_updateRewardsStates`.

## Vulnerability Description
Rewards are calculated only when users interact with the contract (e.g., deposit, withdraw). By depositing large amounts just before a reward notification or withdrawal, users can steal rewards accrued during periods they were not staked.

```solidity
/**
	 * @dev Updates the rewards for an account for all reward tokens.
	 * @param account The account to update.
	 */
	function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

## Likelihood
High in competitive environments where users actively monitor reward cycles.

## Impact
Legitimate users receive fewer rewards. Attackers extract value without meaningful participation.

## Proof of Concept

Alice front-runs reward distribution
1. Alice monitors mempool for `notifyRewardAmount()` transactions.
2. She deposits `1M SYMM` before the transaction executes.
3. Rewards are distributed proportionally, giving Alice a large share.
4. Alice withdraws immediately after.

## Recommendations
Implement continuous reward accrual using timestamps such that, `rewardPerTokenStored += (timeDelta * rate) / totalSupply)`. Or, use checkpoints to track user stakes over time such as the ones in veToken models.
