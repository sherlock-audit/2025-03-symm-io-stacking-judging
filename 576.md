# {Admin} has unrestricted access to recover any token, including reward tokens, which may bypass intended restrictions

### Summary

The `rescueTokens` function allows the protocol's admin to recover any token from the contract without restrictions. This includes reward tokens, potentially bypassing security mechanisms designed to prevent unauthorized withdrawals. While this function is useful for recovering mistakenly sent tokens, it also introduces the risk of admins withdrawing reward tokens that should otherwise remain locked per protocol design.

### Root Cause

The rescueTokens() function does not check whether the token being recovered is a reward token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must hold reward tokens.
2. The admin must call rescueTokens() to transfer tokens to an external address.
3. No additional validation exists in rescueTokens() to differentiate between regular and reward tokens.



### External Pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path

1. The contract accumulates reward tokens over time.
2. An admin calls rescueTokens() to transfer reward tokens to an external wallet.
3. The function executes successfully without checking if the token was a reward token.
4. Reward token safeguards (such as `lastUpdateTime == 0` check) are bypassed, and tokens that should remain locked are withdrawn.

### Impact

Reward tokens that should remain locked per protocol logic can be extracted by the admin.

### PoC

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a check to prevent rescueTokens() from withdrawing tokens that have a lastUpdateTime > 0.
