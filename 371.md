# wrong implement of _addLiquidity

### Summary

here in _addLiquidity we are approving the router 
usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
		usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
		symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
		PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
		PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));


 In the _addLiquidity function, the permits are approved with uint48(block.timestamp) as the deadline, which means the approvals expire immediately. This can lead to transaction failures if the transaction isn't mined in the same block.

Immediate Expiration: The permit approval is set to expire at uint48(block.timestamp), which is the current block's timestamp. This means the approval is only valid for the exact moment it's created.

Transaction Timing Issues: In blockchain transactions, there's always a delay between when a transaction is created, submitted to the mempool, and finally included in a block. If the block timestamp advances even by a second before the transaction is mined, the permit will already be expired when the router tries to use it.

Front-running Vulnerability: This creates a condition where transactions can be easily front-run. A malicious validator or miner could see the transaction, understand that it will fail due to the immediate expiration, and manipulate the execution order or timestamp.

Technical Implementation: The Permit2 system is designed to allow approvals with future expiration timestamps to give transactions breathing room. By using block.timestamp instead of block.timestamp + someBuffer (e.g., 15 minutes), the contract essentially creates a race condition where the approval must be used in the exact same block it was created.

Chain Congestion Impact: During periods of network congestion, transactions might take multiple blocks to be included, virtually guaranteeing that these approvals will expire before they can be used.


we are not doing a  zero approval specifically for the ROUTER after the  calling  the router to add liquidity.

PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), 0, uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));

uint48 deadline = uint48(block.timestamp + 15 minutes);
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), deadline);
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), deadline);


after the calling  the router to add liquidity.use zero approval.
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), 0, uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), 0, uint48(block.timestamp));
