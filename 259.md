# Reward Token Removal Prevents User Claims

### Summary

In the configureRewardToken function that allows the owner (with the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) to remove a reward token while users still have unclaimed rewards. If a token is removed from rewardTokens, users will be unable to claim their accumulated rewards in that token, resulting in a potential loss of funds for the users.



```solidity
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
This doesnt mitigate it since it will pass if pendingRewards are 9 which still causes loss of rewards claiming for exact token by users


### Root Cause

pendingRewards  for exact token is compared if its bigger than 10  instead it should be if its bigger than 0 to make sure there are no rewards left in the token to be claimed

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE needs to call configureRewardToken with address token and status value. the pendingReward Tokens should be less than 10


### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

Users who have accrued rewards in a specific token may lose access to their funds if the token is removed from the reward system.

The contract does include a safeguard (pendingRewards[token] > 10), but this threshold is ineffective since any value below 10 allows token removal, which could still impact users with unclaimed rewards.

This gives the owner the ability to censor withdrawals of reward tokens by removing them prematurely, violating user expectations of fair reward distribution.
