# Vesting plan might not be modifyed with at desired amount under certain coditions

### Summary

In Vesting.sol an admin can modify someone's vesting plan via _resetVestingPlans(), the problem with the modification is that it's required for a new vested amount to be higher then already claimed amount.
```solidity
	function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();//@audit here should be compar against locked
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```
While devs understand such behaviour well (it was explicitly commented), there is might be a problem with such design choice.
Because claimed amount increasing over time (amount of vested funds is unvesting while vested duration proportionaly) we might ended up in situation when a lot of time since start of vesting passed and unlocked amount already big enough.
It will lead to the case where admins desired amount to modify is smaller then unlocked funds and function will revert obviously, preventing admins to modify someone's vesting plan the way they wanted to.

Also revert of this function will affect SymmVesting.sol _addLiquidityProcess().  So under described condition users might lose an opportunity to un-vest their tokens by adding them as liquidity. So addLiquidity() and addLiquidityByPercentage() will be dosed as well

### Root Cause

Vesting.sol
```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();//@audit here should be compar against locked
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

big enough time should pass since starting of vesting plan to accumulate big enough claimed funds

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

will happen itself
big enough time passed since starting of vesting plan to accumulate big enough claimed funds
admins decide to modify vesting plan with small amount, but function reverts because this small amount will be lower than claimed funds/ or user decide to un-vest by adding liquidity


### Impact

It will prevent devs to modify someone's vesting plan with desired amount, also revert of this function will affect SymmVesting.sol _addLiquidityProcess().  So under described condition users might lose an opportunity to un-vest their tokens by adding them as liquidity. So addLiquidity() and addLiquidityByPercentage() will be dosed as well

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

clean all restrictions about amounts
