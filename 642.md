# Imbalanced SYMM LP deposit with zero usdcin will lower price of SYMM requiring subsequent deposits to include more USDC losing funds

### Summary

In the vesting contract, the `getLiquidityQuote` says the usdcin and SYMM tokens needed to deposit in the balancer pool.

The issue comes because of a rounding issue as it already is 80:20 SYMM-USDC balancer pool and the ratio allows it to require lower than necessary USDC.

However with enough precision loss, we require zero USDC deposit with the SYMM token. This can be repeated until there is more SYMM for given USDC rising price and requiring subsequent `addLiquidity` users to get less LP tokens for their SYMM tokens and also give more USDC compared to the pool's initial state before the attack

rounding error allows zero deposit for `usdcIn`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.

### External Pre-conditions

1.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deposits SYMM tokens as long as usdcIn is zero (at this point in time it's as high as 100 * 1e12 SYMM)
2. Attacker receives LP tokens and more users/ attackers join in to inflate SYMM - USDC
3. Victim tries to add liquidity with his locked SYMM, however the price manipulation leaves him with less lp tokens and more USDC deposit needed, this is in contrast to the LP tokens he would've received if the attack didn't happen.

### Impact

The User loses more value of his locked SYMM and funds because of the attack

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

don't allow zero usdc deposits
