# Precision-Critical Staking Rewards: The Hidden Loss from Integer Division

### Summary

A significant mathematical precision vulnerability exists in SymmStaking's reward calculation that silently reduces or completely eliminates rewards for certain token configurations. The contract's integer division approach in calculating reward rates creates a mathematical floor that prevents the distribution of tokens below specific thresholds, effectively trapping rewards within the contract despite appearing available in accounting systems.

[SymmStaking.sol:366-379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366)

### Root Cause

The core vulnerability lies in how the reward distribution rate is calculated in SymmStaking.sol's reward management system:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```
This integer division creates a mathematical threshold where any amount less than the divisor (state.duration) results in a rate of zero. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

With the standard duration setting of 604,800 seconds (one week), this creates several problematic scenarios:

1. Full reward elimination: Any tokens with quantity below 604,800 base units receive a rate of zero, making them completely undistributable
2. Partial reward truncation: Even for larger amounts, the system silently truncates up to 604,799 tokens per distribution period
3. Compounding inaccuracy: Each truncation event increases the discrepancy between accounting expectations and actual distributions


For tokens with limited decimal places like USDC (6 decimals), this threshold represents a much higher effective value than for tokens with 18 decimals, creating inconsistent behavior across different reward types.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

The vulnerability creates distinct mathematical thresholds that determine reward distribution behavior:

- For tokens where amount < duration: 100% of rewards become inaccessible
- For tokens where amount > duration: Up to (amount % duration) tokens become trapped
- Effect amplifies with tokens having fewer decimal places (e.g., USDC)

The system silently passes these thresholds without warnings or errors, creating a gradual divergence between expected and actual reward distributions.

### Impact

This mathematical precision issue creates several cascading effects throughout the staking ecosystem:

1. Stakers receive fewer rewards than the protocol intends to distribute
2. The accounting system increasingly diverges from reality with each reward cycle
3. Protocol administrators face ongoing operational burdens to detect and correct these discrepancies
4. Token projects with fewer decimal places face disproportionate reward losses
5. Even when detected, manual intervention is required through the rescueTokens() function

While tokens remain technically recoverable by administrators, this creates operational complexity, degrades user experience, and undermines confidence in the reward distribution mechanism.

### PoC

```solidity
function demonstratePrecisionLoss() public {
    // Setup environment with realistic parameters
    address testRewardToken = address(0xUSDC);  // Simulating USDC with 6 decimals
    uint256 smallRewardAmount = 500000;         // 0.5 USDC (below weekly threshold)
    uint256 largeRewardAmount = 10000000;       // 10 USDC
    uint256 weeklyDuration = 604800;            // 1 week in seconds
    
    // First scenario: Small amount below threshold
    staking._addRewardsForToken(testRewardToken, smallRewardAmount);
    uint256 calculatedRate = staking.rewardState(testRewardToken).rate;
    
    // Verify rate is zero due to integer division floor
    assert(calculatedRate == 0);
    console.log("Distribution rate for 0.5 USDC: 0 tokens/second");
    console.log("Trapped tokens: 500000 (100% of allocation)");
    
    // Second scenario: Larger amount with partial truncation
    staking._addRewardsForToken(testRewardToken, largeRewardAmount);
    calculatedRate = staking.rewardState(testRewardToken).rate;
    
    // Calculate actual distribution vs. expected
    uint256 expectedDistribution = largeRewardAmount;
    uint256 actualDistribution = calculatedRate * weeklyDuration;
    uint256 trappedTokens = expectedDistribution - actualDistribution;
    
    console.log("Expected distribution: 10000000 units");
    console.log("Actual distribution:", actualDistribution, "units");
    console.log("Trapped tokens:", trappedTokens, "units");
}
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this mathematical precision vulnerability, the contract should implement the following approach:

**Scaled Precision Calculation:**
```solidity
// Use a scaling factor to preserve precision
uint256 constant PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e18;

if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = (amount * PRECISION_FACTOR) / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = ((amount * PRECISION_FACTOR) + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```
