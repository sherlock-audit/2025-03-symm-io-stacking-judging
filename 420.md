# Rounding in `_addRewardsForToken()` for usdc/usdt will be huge

### Summary

As we know, the default duration will be 1 week, which is `864_000` seconds.

For every addition of usdc/usdt, we are risking [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) that a rounding loss of maximum `864_000 - 1` will occur, which is almost a dollar, but that is on every single call to `_addRewardsForToken()`.

Add to that on each call we will recalculate the `state.rate` and will again produce a rounding loss, this deserves a high severity due to it being replayable.

### Root Cause

No precision mechanism to escape the rounding loss in the calculation of `state.rate` in the function `_addRewardsForToken()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate users continuously add usdc/usdt to `_addRewardsForToken()`, producing rounding loss each time

### Impact

Rounding loss that will be produced each time `_addRewardsForToken()` is called, and given that it will be continously invoked, it will be of a high impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a precision mechanism to the `state.rate`
