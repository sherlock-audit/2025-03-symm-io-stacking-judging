# User can unlock tokens before schedule due to vesting error in addLiquidityProcess()

## Description
When `addLiquidity()` --> [_addLiquidityProcess()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L158) is called a new vesting schedule for `SYMM_LP` is created via `_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts)`. The second param passed by the function is `block.timestamp` which starts the vesting from current time. The function fails to validate if the user's `SYMM` vesting was due to start in the future i.e. if `symmVestingPlan.startTime > block.timestamp` is true or not. In such cases the `lpVestingPlan.startTime` needs to be equal to `symmVestingPlan.startTime` instead of `block.timestamp`.

This gives a malicious user an attack path to unlock their `SYMM` tokens before time in form of `SYMM_LP` tokens:
1. Alice has a `SYMM` vesting plan with start time `T+1` month and ending at `T+5` month i.e. vesting duration of 4 months. Let's assume quantity of `SYMM` vested as `100`.
2. Alice calls `addLiquidity()` at current timestamp of `T` and this results in locked `SYMM` to be vested as `SYMM_LP` tokens. But this is done via `_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts)` i.e. vesting is immediately started at `T`. The end time here is still `T+5` i.e. vesting duration of 5 months.
3. At `T+1`, Alice claims her unlocked `SYMM_LP` tokens `= 1/5 * 100 = 20` which under her normal `SYMM` vesting schedule would have been zero.

Note that `_resetVestingPlans()` has a similar yet distinct vulnerability which has been reported separately under the title `"Vesting commences immediately & vesting duration is extended if restVestingPlans() is called before startTime"`. That needs to be fixed in conjunction with this one. This is because even if the current issue is fixed, a user can:
    - first call `addLiquidity()` with a small amount (or zero). ( If the current `_setupVestingPlans()` parameter setting vulnerability is fixed inside `_addLiquidityProcess()` then `startTime` gets set properly )
    - then call `addLiquidity()` again with entire locked `SYMM` amount which [this time calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L155-L156) `_resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts)` and resets the `lpVestingPlan.startTime` to current timestamp, causing the vulnerability to re-emerge.

## Impact
Malicious users can use `addLiquidity()` and `addLiquidityByPercentage()` to unlock tokens before time.

## Mitigation
This is the fix for the current param setting issue:
```diff
	function _addLiquidityProcess(
		uint256 amount,
		uint256 minLpAmount,
		uint256 maxUsdcIn
	) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
		// Claim any unlocked SYMM tokens first.
		_claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender);

		VestingPlan storage symmVestingPlan = vestingPlans[SYMM][msg.sender];
		uint256 symmLockedAmount = symmVestingPlan.lockedAmount();
		if (symmLockedAmount < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

		_ensureSufficientBalance(SYMM, amount);

		// Add liquidity to the pool.
		(amountsIn, lpAmount) = _addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);

		// Update SYMM vesting plan by reducing the locked amount.
		symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);

		// Claim any unlocked SYMM LP tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(SYMM_LP, msg.sender);

		VestingPlan storage lpVestingPlan = vestingPlans[SYMM_LP][msg.sender];

		address[] memory users = new address[](1);
		users[0] = msg.sender;
		uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
		amounts[0] = lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount;

		// Increase the locked amount by the received LP tokens.
		if (lpVestingPlan.isSetup()) {
			_resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts);
		} else {
-			_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
+			uint256 lpVestingStartTime = block.timestamp < symmVestingPlan.startTime ? symmVestingPlan.startTime : block.timestamp;
+			_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, lpVestingStartTime, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
		}

		emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, amountsIn[0], amountsIn[1], lpAmount);
	}
