# Future token integrations will silently fail for non-standard tokens due to unsafe transfer usage

### Summary

The use of unsafe `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` in `Vesting.sol` will cause silent failures for non-standard token integrations as the contract uses a generic token system but assumes standard ERC20 revert behavior.

### Root Cause

In [`Vesting.sol:_claimUnlockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272) and [`Vesting.sol:_claimLockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L295) the use of `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` is unsafe as the contract is designed to support any ERC20 token through its generic mapping system `mapping(address => mapping(address => VestingPlan)) public vestingPlans`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to add support for a non-standard token (like USDT) that doesn't revert on failed transfers
2. Users need to have vesting plans set up with these tokens
3. Contract uses basic `transfer` which doesn't check return values

### External Pre-conditions

1. Non-standard ERC20 token that returns false instead of reverting on failed transfers

### Attack Path

1. Protocol adds support for a non-standard token (like USDT)
2. User attempts to claim tokens through `_claimUnlockedToken` or `_claimLockedToken`
3. Transfer fails but returns false instead of reverting
4. Contract continues execution thinking transfer succeeded
5. State is updated but tokens weren't actually transferred

### Impact

The users suffer potential loss of funds when claiming non-standard tokens. The contract state becomes inconsistent with actual token balances, potentially leading to permanent loss of user funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
    // ...
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);
}

function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // ...
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
}
```
