# Incorrect Reward Rate Calculation When Period Finish is Equal to `block.timestamp` in `_addRewardsForToken

### Summary:
The `_addRewardsForToken` function in the contract is intended to update the reward rate for a given token. However, there is an issue in the logic when the reward period has ended (`block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish`). According to the documentation, the new reward rate should be calculated only if the period has actually finished (i.e., when `block.timestamp > state.periodFinish`), but the current implementation calculates it even when the timestamps are equal. This can lead to incorrect reward rate calculations and potential misalignment in reward distribution.

### Root Cause:
- **Incorrect Check for Period End**: The condition `if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish)` is not accurate for determining whether the reward period has ended. According to the documentation, the reward rate should be updated only if the current timestamp is greater than `state.periodFinish` (i.e., when the reward period has truly ended), not when they are equal.
  
  - When `block.timestamp == state.periodFinish`, the rate is being recalculated incorrectly.
  - The logic assumes that the period finishes exactly when `block.timestamp` equals `state.periodFinish`, which might lead to unintended behavior by updating the rate too early.

### Impact:
- **Incorrect Reward Rate**: Since the reward rate is recalculated at the wrong time, rewards could be emitted at the wrong rate or in an inaccurate distribution pattern. This could lead to users receiving rewards at incorrect intervals or amounts.
- **Potential Overpayment/Underpayment of Rewards**: Users may receive more or fewer rewards than expected because the rewards are calculated based on an incorrect time period, affecting the overall functionality of the staking or reward system.

### Attack Path:

### Mitigation:
1. **Fix the Condition for Period End**: The reward rate should only be recalculated when `block.timestamp > state.periodFinish`. This ensures that the rate is updated only after the reward period has truly ended, not when the timestamps are equal.
   ```solidity
   if (block.timestamp > state.periodFinish) {
       state.rate = amount / state.duration;
   } else {
       uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
       uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
   }
   ```

2. **Proper Handling of Time Periods**: Ensure that any calculation of reward distribution properly considers whether the period has ended (`block.timestamp > state.periodFinish`) before recalculating rates. This will ensure that rewards are distributed correctly across the full time period.
   - **Period Finish Check**: Only update the rate if the current time has passed the previous periodâ€™s finish time, ensuring that rewards are calculated accurately based on the actual period.
