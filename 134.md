# Unsafe token transfers in `Vesting.sol` can lead to state inconsistencies

### Summary

The use of transfer without checking the return value will cause a loss of vested tokens for users as failed transfers (in non-reverting ERC20 tokens) will irreversibly update the contract’s state, marking tokens as claimed even if the transfer failed.

### Root Cause

In `Vesting.sol:272, 295, 296` the internal functions `_claimUnlockedToken` and `_claimLockedToken` ([code link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272)), the transfer method is used without checking its success status. ERC20 tokens that return false on failure (instead of reverting) will cause the contract to incorrectly update state variables (e.g., claimedAmount, totalVested) even if the transfer fails.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Token implementations that return false instead of reverting
2. Token transfers being temporarily paused (e.g., USDC during SVB crisis)
3. Token blacklisting or transfer limits

### External Pre-conditions

The ERC20 token’s transfer function does not revert on failure.

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a claim via claimUnlockedToken or claimLockedToken.
2. The contract calculates claimableAmount and updates state variables (e.g., claimedAmount += claimableAmount, reducing totalVested).
3. The ERC20 transfer fails (e.g., due to blacklisted user address) but returns false instead of reverting.
4. The contract does not revert, and the state changes persist, marking the tokens as "claimed" even though the user never received them.

### Impact

Users suffer a permanent loss of their vested tokens.
 For example:
If a user’s claimableAmount is 100 tokens, but the transfer fails, the contract reduces totalVested by 100 and increases claimedAmount by 100. The user cannot re-claim these tokens, as the contract now considers them already claimed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace transfer with OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer from the SafeERC20 library to enforce reverts on failures:
```javascript
// In _claimUnlockedToken:
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

// In _claimLockedToken:
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```
