# Precision loss when calculating `state.rate` in `_addRewardsForToken`.

### Summary



Precision loss when calculating `state.rate` in `_addRewardsForToken`.

### Root Cause

Precision loss occurs in the [\_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370) function when updating the reward rate:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration; // @audit Precision loss occurs here
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

Since Solidity performs integer division, any remainder is truncated. If `state.duration = 604800` seconds (1 week) and the reward token is WBTC (8 decimals), then when `_addRewardsForToken` is called, precision loss occurs:

- Suppose `amount = 1e8` WBTC (1 WBTC).
- `1e8 / 604800` results in **165** instead of **165.289** due to truncation.
- The missing **0.289** WBTC per second accumulates over time, leading to a total loss of **~0.006 WBTC** over the full reward duration.

At a rate of **$80,000 per WBTC**, this equates to **~$480 USD in lost rewards**, which will never be distributed to stakers.


### Internal Pre-conditions



WBTC (8 decimals) is used as a reward token.

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact


Stakers lose access to a portion of their rewards due to precision loss, leading to inefficiencies in the reward distribution mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To mitigate precision loss, scale the reward rate by `1e18` before performing the division:

```solidity
state.rate = (amount * 1e18) / state.duration;
```

All subsequent calculations should be adjusted to maintain precision when distributing rewards.
