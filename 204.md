# Incorrect calculation of totalVested in Vesting::_resetVestingPlans

### Summary

An incorrect calculation of `totalVested[token]` in [`_resetVestingPlans`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222) will cause incorrect vesting accounting for the protocol as the function incorrectly subtracts previously unlocked tokens twice, leading to potential over-allocation or under-allocation of vested tokens.

### Root Cause

In [`Vesting.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222), the function `_resetVestingPlans` incorrectly assigns `oldTotal` after calling `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)`, which reduces `totalVested[token]`. This results in `oldTotal` capturing only the remaining locked amount instead of the full original vesting amount.

```solidity
totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
```
double subtracts the unlocked amount, leading to an incorrect final `totalVested[token]` value.

####  Detailed Explanation 

- Unlocking tokens before capturing the old vesting amount
   ```solidity
   229: _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
   ```
   - `_claimUnlockedToken` reduces `totalVested[token]` by the amount of unlocked tokens.
   - This means that after calling this function, the vesting plan only contains locked tokens.

- Capturing `oldTotal` after the unlocked tokens have already been removed  
   ```solidity
   232: uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
   ```
   - Since `_claimUnlockedToken` has already removed unlocked tokens, `vestingPlan.lockedAmount()` now only represents the locked portion, not the full previous vesting amount.  
   - However, `oldTotal` is supposed to capture the entire previous vesting amount, including both locked and unlocked tokens.

- Incorrect `totalVested[token]` update  
   ```solidity
   234: totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
   ```
   - Working of current code  
     - `_claimUnlockedToken` has already subtracted the unlocked amount from `totalVested[token]`.
     - `oldTotal` only includes locked tokens (not the full amount).
     - The subtraction of `oldTotal` results in a second deduction of the unlocked portion.  
   - The effect: 
     - The contract thinks fewer tokens are vested than actually are.  
     - This can allow more tokens to be allocated than should be possible or prevent legitimate token allocations.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A vesting plan exists for a user with some tokens locked and some unlocked.  
2. `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)` reduces `totalVested[token]` by the unlocked amount.  
3. `oldTotal` is assigned after `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)`, meaning it only reflects the locked portion.  
4. The function then subtracts `oldTotal` (which no longer includes unlocked tokens) from `totalVested[token]`, effectively subtracting the unlocked tokens twice.

### External Pre-conditions

This issue is contract-internal** and does not depend on external protocol interactions.

### Attack Path

1. A user with a vesting plan has tokens in both the locked and unlocked states.  
2. A protocol administrator calls `resetVestingPlans` to update the user's vesting schedule.  
3. The function first claims any unlocked tokens, reducing `totalVested[token]` by the unlocked amount.  
4. It then calculates `oldTotal` as `vestingPlan.lockedAmount()`, which only represents the locked tokens (not the full vested amount).  
5. The function subtracts `oldTotal` from `totalVested[token]` again, effectively double-subtracting the unlocked portion.  
6. As a result, `totalVested[token]` becomes artificially low, allowing more tokens to be allocated than should be possible or preventing legitimate allocations.

### Impact

- The contract may incorrectly allow more tokens to be allocated than available, creating an imbalance.  
- Some users might not be able to claim their rightful vested tokens because the system falsely assumes fewer tokens are available.  
- If exploited at scale, incorrect vesting calculations could drain contract reserves or lock legitimate claims.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue:  
- Store the total vested amount before calling `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)`. 
- Use `vestingPlan.totalAmount()` instead of `vestingPlan.lockedAmount()` when updating `totalVested[token]`.  

### **Updated Code:**  
```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {  
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        // Capture the full old total before unlocking
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.totalAmount();  // Get total amount before any claim

        // Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);

        if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();

        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);

        // Correct totalVested update
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + vestingPlan.totalAmount();

        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
```
