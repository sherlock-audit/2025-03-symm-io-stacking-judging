# Reward Amount can be reduced if `notifyRewardAmount` is called in mid duration

### Summary

The duration reset in `_addRewardsForToken` will cause reduced rewards for stakers as any user can call `notifyRewardAmount` mid-period/duration to dilute rewards.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol` the `_addRewardsForToken` function resets the reward period duration to the default value (1 week) instead of using the remaining time from the current period when new rewards are added mid-period.
Anyone can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function anytime which will dilutes the rewards and the users will receives less reward because of the reward being diluted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call configureRewardToken to whitelist a reward token (e.g., USDT).

2. Any user needs to call notifyRewardAmount to initialize a reward period with a non-zero amount.

3. At least sometime should be passed [eg : 3 days]

4. Anyone can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function and add reward token in the protocol  to decrease the rewardRate per token and it will result in users receiving less rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `configureRewardToken` to enable USDT as a reward token.
2. Time passes lets assume 3 days after making few deposits by users.
3. Someone will call `notifyRewardAmount` and add more USDT 
4. Contract will resets duration to 1 week again instead of using remaining 4 days
5. Reward rate will drop resulting in user receiving less rewards

### Impact

The stakers will suffer losses as per their expected rewards. Attackers can gried the system by intentionally diluting rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Modify _addRewardsForToken to use remaining time instead of resetting duration:
```diff

function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
-			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
+                     state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining; 
+                     state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + remaining;
                		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

```
2. Restrict notifyRewardAmount: Add access control to prevent unauthorized users from diluting rewards:
