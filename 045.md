# malicious user can extend the reward duration by calling `notifyRewardAmount`

### Summary

`SymmStaking:notifyRewardAmount` doesn’t have access control and malicious user can call it with something like 1 wei to extend the periodFinish to delay the reward emission.

### Root Cause

if we look at the `notifyRewardAmount` function then it doesn’t have a access control meaning anyone can call it and supply any amount of reward they want. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275C11-L275C29

```solidity
/**
	 * @notice Notifies the contract about new reward amounts.
	 * @param tokens Array of reward token addresses.
	 * @param amounts Array of reward amounts corresponding to each token.
	 */
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
	->		_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
	
	
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
->	state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
	
	
```

The `_addRewardsForToken` function here will update the `periodFinish` variable by `rewardDuration`. 



Everytime the notify reward is called in this manner with 1 wei, the reward rate decreases while increasing the period finish because of this decreasing reward rate, the user receives much less rewards than intended
In the same period.
The malicious actor can call this function with just 1 wei of any reward token to extend the `periodFinish` and cause a delay in the reward emission.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1000 tokens are to be distributed in 10 days. This means a reward rate of 100 reward per day. Someone calls notify reward with 1 token at day 5.

So, the new reward rate will be -> leftover + amount / duration

- 500 + 1 / 10 which is approximately 50 tokens per day.

Hence the reward rate decreases and the periodFinish gets updated by block.timestamp + 10 days. So, instead of finishing in 10 days it finishes in 15 days.

This is a loss for the user

### Impact

 `periodFinish` will get extended each time this function is called and malicious actor can call this many times to delay the reward emission.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

implement the access control to notifyRewardAmount like we have in a original implementation from curve finance.
