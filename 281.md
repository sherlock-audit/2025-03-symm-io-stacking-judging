# `setBatchAllocations` will DoS if `users` array gets too large

### Summary

The `SymmAllocationClaimer::setBatchAllocations` function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack when the users array gets too large. This is due to the unbounded loop that processes each user and their allocation, which can cause the transaction to run out of gas and the current event emission is emitting an entire array of users, which can contribute to the DoS also since it's costly even though it's reading from calldata.

### Root Cause

Unbounded for loop that iterates over the users and allocations arrays. 
Each iteration performs multiple gas-intensive operations, including validation checks, state updates, and array operations. When the arrays are large, the gas consumption can exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.
Event emission is emiting entire users array, which even though it's reading from calldata, it can be very costly.


### Internal Pre-conditions

`SETTER_ROLE` needs to call the function 
The `users` and `allocationsÂ´ arrays must be of equal length.
The `users` array must not contain any zero addresses.
The `allocations` array must not contain any zero values.
The users and allocations arrays have to be provided in order for the SETTER_ROLE to call this

### External Pre-conditions

`users` array need to be really big


### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates multiple addresses to interact with the loop
2.  Or the array gets really crowded without anyone trying to exploit it, just gets crowded
3. The function enters the loop to process each user and their allocation.
4. Due to the large size of the arrays, the gas consumption exceeds the block gas limit.
5. The transaction will most likely fail due to surpass the block gas limit

### Impact

Protocol will be unable to set allocations for multiple users in a single transaction, including updating totalAllocation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Process the batchAllocation in smaller batch sizes:

Current version of setBatchAllocations:

```solidity 
function setBatchAllocations(address[] calldata users, uint256[] calldata allocations) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
		if (users.length != allocations.length) revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
		if (users.length == 0) revert EmptyArrays();
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
			if (users[i] == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
			// Subtract old allocation from total
			totalAllocation = totalAllocation - userAllocations[users[i]];
			// Set new allocation
			userAllocations[users[i]] = allocations[i];
			// Add new allocation to total
			totalAllocation = totalAllocation + allocations[i];
		}
		if (totalAllocation > MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN) {
			revert TotalAllocationExceedsMax(totalAllocation, MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN);
		}
		emit BatchAllocationsSet(users, allocations);
	}
```

Updated version of setBatchAllocations:

```solidity
function setBatchAllocations(address[] calldata users, uint256[] calldata allocations) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    if (users.length != allocations.length) revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
    if (users.length == 0) revert EmptyArrays();

    uint256 batchSize = 100; // Define a batch size to process in chunks
    uint256 totalBatches = (users.length + batchSize - 1) / batchSize; // Calculate the total number of batches

    for (uint256 batch = 0; batch < totalBatches; batch++) {
        uint256 start = batch * batchSize;
        uint256 end = start + batchSize > users.length ? users.length : start + batchSize;

        for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
            if (users[i] == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

            totalAllocation = totalAllocation - userAllocations[users[i]];
            userAllocations[users[i]] = allocations[i];
            totalAllocation = totalAllocation + allocations[i];
        }

        emit BatchAllocationsSet(start, end);
    }

    if (totalAllocation > MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN) {
        revert TotalAllocationExceedsMax(totalAllocation, MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN);
    }
}
```
