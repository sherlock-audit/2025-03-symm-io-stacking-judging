# users could claim more tokens that they are expected to claim because of a vulnerability in resetVestingPlans

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L80

When a user vesting plan is set , is been recorded and as time passes rewards are unlocked and users can claim these unlock rewards , now the issue is when admin want to reset users vesting plan, maybe to a more higher or more lower amount

When SETTER ROLE want to reset these plan, user already claimed token is been set to 0 this could lead to users earning more tokens than they should because the already withdrawed tokens are not accounted for 
  

### Root Cause

in the LibVestingPlan.sol#L80 users claimed amount is been reset to 0

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admins need to call resetVestingPlans to reset amount for user 

### External Pre-conditions

When admins calls resetVestingPlans it calls another internal function will set users amount to a new amount and didnt account for what user already withdraw in the past

### Attack Path

* admin setup a vesting for alice
* after half of the period
* alice withdraw half of her funds
* later on admin calls reset to reset the amount maybe to a lower amount
* then it set already claimed to 0
* no account of what alice have withdraw in the past and no account of what was remaining in the past vesting of alice , 
* at that point the past  vesting for alice will just dissapper , alice didn't  complete his past vesting withdrawal but already withdrawed part of it 
* no account of alice past vesting it will just be like a new vesting for alice 
* making the one already withdrawed as free money


### Impact

User will claim more token than they should 

- Alice's original allocation: 10,000 tokens
- Alice's reduced allocation after reset: 8,000 tokens
- Total claimed by Alice: ,13, 000 tokens

### PoC

## Setup

1. Admin sets up a vesting plan for Alice with 10,000 SYMM  tokens vesting over 6 months
    - Start date: April 1, 2025
    - End date: October 1, 2025

## Exploit Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Claims

2. **3 months pass** (July 1, 2025)
3. Alice has 5,000 tokens unlocked (50% of total)
4. Alice claims these 5,000 tokens via `claimUnlockedToken(SYMM)`
5. After claiming:
    
    ```solidity
    Alice's vesting plan: {  amount: 10,000  claimedAmount: 5,000  startTime: April 1, 2025  endTime: October 1, 2025}
    ```
    

### Phase 2: Admin Resets Plan

6. Admin calls `resetVestingPlans(SYMM, [alice's address], [8,000])`
7. This first calls `_claimUnlockedToken` to claim any currently unlocked tokens
    - At this point, nothing additional to claim as Alice already claimed all unlocked tokens
8. The reset occurs through `vestingPlan.resetAmount(8,000)`
9. Critical vulnerability: `resetAmount` sets `claimedAmount` to 0
10. After reset:
    
    ```solidity
    Alice's vesting plan: {  amount: 8,000  claimedAmount: 0  // Reset to 0, losing record of 5,000 previously claimed  startTime: July 1, 2025 (current time)  endTime: October 1, 2025 
    ```
    

### Phase 3: Double-Claiming

1. Another 3 months pass (October 1, 2025)
2. 100% of the reset vesting period has elapsed, unlocking all tokens 8000
3. Alice claims these 8,000 tokens
4. Total claimed by Alice: 13,,000 tokens (5,000 before reset + 8,000 after)
5. which maybe the protocol only want alice to claim only 8000


### Mitigation

there is no need setting the claimed token to 0 since it can be used to track how much a user have withdrawed in the past
