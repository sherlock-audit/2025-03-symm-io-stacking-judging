# Penalty Receiver will centralize staking rewards from legitimate stakers

### Summary

The choice to send early-unlock penalties to a staking-enabled address will cause reward centralization for all stakers as the penalty receiver will accumulate SYMM and dominate reward pools.

### Root Cause

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to send 50% of early-unlocked SYMM to lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver  is a mistake if the receiver can stake SYMM, creating a self-reinforcing reward monopoly.

(in Vesting.sol:296)
```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L296

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Receiver Configuration: lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver (set by admin) must be a contract/address that stakes SYMM via SymmStaking.deposit().

2. Staking Whitelist: SYMM must be whitelisted as a reward token in SymmStaking (though SYMM is the staking token, not a reward token - this may require protocol misconfiguration).

### External Pre-conditions

1. Penalty Volume: Users must frequently early-unlock SYMM, generating penalty inflows.

2. No Burn Mechanism: Protocol lacks SYMM burn logic for penalties.

### Attack Path

1. Admin configures lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver to a staking contract/DAO treasury.

2. Users call claimLockedToken():

- 50% penalty SYMM sent to lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver.

3. Receiver auto-stakes penalties via SymmStaking.deposit().

4. Receiver earns disproportionate staking rewards due to large SYMM balance.

5. Cycle repeats: More penalties → larger stake → more rewards → further centralization.

### Impact

- Legitimate Stakers: Suffer reduced rewards (receiver’s stake dilutes others’ share).

- Protocol: Loses decentralization as receiver controls >50% of staked SYMM over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Governance Oversight: Add onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) to modify lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver.
