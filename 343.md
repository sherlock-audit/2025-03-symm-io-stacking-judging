# Incorrect Scaling Factor for USDC Token Conversion Leads to Insufficient Fund Provision During Liquidity Addition

In the [getLiquidityQuote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247-L256) function, the contract calculates the required USDC for a given SYMM amount by first computing:  
```solidity
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```
and then scaling it with:  
```solidity
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```  
This second line mistakenly divides the calculated `usdcAmount` by 1e12 (since 1e18/1e30 equals 1e–12), which drastically underestimates the amount of USDC required. The miscalculation directly leads to an insufficient USDC transfer during the liquidity addition process, causing the liquidity transaction to revert due to an imbalance in token ratios.

#### Root Cause
The primary cause is the erroneous application of an inappropriate scaling factor in the liquidity quote calculation that incorrectly converts token decimals—USDC, which typically uses 6 decimals, is already correctly represented by the initial ratio, making the subsequent division by 1e12 unnecessary and flawed.

#### Impact
This bug results in insufficient USDC being provided during liquidity addition, leading to transaction failures and potentially locking funds within the contract.

#### Mitigation
Adjust the scaling factor in the USDC calculation to correctly account for token decimals, ensuring the computed `usdcAmount` reflects the true required amount without an unnecessary division.
