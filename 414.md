# In `rewardPerToken()` a big rounding loss vector is uncovered

### Summary

The calculation in `rewardPerToken` is going to produce a rounding loss in tokens such as usdt/usdc as they will be 1e6 decimal, but the staking token is symmio, a 1e18 decimal token, which is going to be the divisor via `totalSupply`

### Root Cause

The root cause is the use of the divisor `totalSupply` without no precision on the rate per second, as the `totalSupply` is symmio token being 1e18, and the reward as outlined may be usdt or usdc which are both 1e6, so this will produce very oftenly a big big rounding loss that will accumulate to an ever bigger overtime, each time `rewardPerToken()` is invoked and written into `state.perTokenStored`

### Internal Pre-conditions

`rewardPerToken()` being invoked in `updateRewardsState()` often, which will be surely the case.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Every single time `_updateRewardsStates()` is called in functions such as `deposit()`/`withdraw()` will lead to the rounding loss and given that they will be invoked relatively often, it will be a big issue

### Impact

Big rounding loss as time goes for the reward per token, leading to a high impact (loss of more than 1%)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use precision when calculating `state.perTokenStored`
