# Locked Token Claim Fails Due to Redundant Unlocked Token Check

### Summary

When a user attempts to claim locked tokens using the _claimLockedToken function, the process fails due to a redundant check in the _resetVestingPlans function. This check, intended to ensure that the new locked amount is not less than the already unlocked amount, erroneously reverts the transaction when more than half of the initially locked tokens have been unlocked, blocking valid locked token claims.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

The redundant condition in `_resetVestingPlans`
```solidity

if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();

```
causes the claim operation to revert. When the vesting plan has progressed such that more than half of the tokens are unlocked, any attempt to claim locked tokens (which involves calling vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount)) results in amount being less than the unlocked tokens, triggering the revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user's vesting plan has advanced significantly, resulting in more than 50% of the initially locked tokens being unlocked.

The claim process internally adjusts the locked amount by subtracting the claim amount, making the new lock amount lower than the unlocked tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

A user initiates a locked token claim via the _claimLockedToken function during a later stage of the vesting schedule.

The system has already unlocked a substantial portion of the tokens, which is common as the vesting period progresses.

### Attack Path

The user calls _claimLockedToken to claim a portion of their locked tokens.

The function first invokes _claimUnlockedToken, which updates the vesting plan by increasing the unlocked token count.

The claim process then attempts to reduce the locked tokens by calling vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount).

The _resetVestingPlans function is executed, where the check if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) is evaluated.

Since more than half of the tokens are already unlocked, this condition is met, and the transaction reverts, preventing the claim.

### Impact

Users are unable to claim their locked tokens when a significant portion of the tokens has already vested.

### PoC
