# Reward distribution period may be extended by malicious users.

### Summary

Malicious users can extend the rewards distribution period via notify one wei reward.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292), admin or users can distribute some rewards into staking contract.

Each time we notify rewards, we will start one new distribution period. And the remaining reward tokens will be added into the new distribution period.

The problem is that malicious users can notify 1 wei reward token. This will extend the distribution period.
For example:
1. The admin distributes 100 USDC for the staking contract in timestamp X, the distribution period is 1 week.
2. Alice is the only staker, Alice expects to get the 100 USDC rewards.
3. In timestamp X + 3.5 days, the malicious user Bob notifies one wei USDC via `notifyRewardAmount`. The distribute rate does not change, but we start one new distribution period, and the updated period finish will be `timestamp X + 10.5 days`.
4. Alice cannot get the expected rewards in one week, she has to wait for one long time to get the expected rewards.

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

```

### Attack Path

1. The admin distributes 100 USDC for the staking contract in timestamp X, the distribution period is 1 week.
2. Alice is the only staker, Alice expects to get the 100 USDC rewards.
3. In timestamp X + 3.5 days, the malicious user Bob notifies one wei USDC via `notifyRewardAmount`. The distribute rate does not change, but we start one new distribution period, and the updated period finish will be `timestamp X + 10.5 days`.
4. Alice cannot get the expected rewards in one week, she has to wait for one long time to get the expected rewards.


### Impact

Users' expected reward distribution period may be extended. Users need more time than expected before they can claim their expected rewards.
