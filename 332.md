# [M-01] - Immediate Permit2 Approval Expiration Can Prevent Liquidity Provision

### Summary

Inside the `SymmVesting` contract, there is a function `_addLiquidity` which when called sets Permit2 approvals to expire at the current block’s timestamp.

This causes the approvals to expire almost immediately. As a result, the Router will not have valid approval to transfer SYMM/USDC, breaking liquidity-adding functionality.

### Root Cause


The code uses `block.timestamp` as the Permit2 expiration, rather than a future timestamp

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user invokes `_addLiquidity` with `symmIn > 0` and `usdcIn > 0`.
2. The code calls `PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, ...)` and `PERMIT2.approve(USDC, ...)` with `expiration = block.timestamp`.

### External Pre-conditions

None specifically required from external protocols (the vulnerability arises solely from the code’s use of `block.timestamp` as an immediate expiry).

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `_addLiquidityProcess` → `_addLiquidity`.
2. Permit2 approvals are created with `expiration = block.timestamp`.
3. The approvals expire in the same block, preventing the Router from pulling tokens.

### Impact

- Users may not be able to add liquidity as intended.
- This could break a core feature, resulting in failed transactions or stuck liquidity operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a future expiration, e.g. block.timestamp + 1 hour, to ensure the Router can use the approval.
