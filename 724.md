# Missing gap in SymmStaking contract

## Summary and impact
The ‘SymmStaking’ contract is intended to be an upgradeable smart contract, but do not have a ‘_gap’ variable.

In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a ‘_gap’ to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables. This is especially important when inheriting from multiple upgradeable contracts.

## Recommended mitigation steps
Include a ‘_gap’ as storage variable to ‘SymmStaking’ contract to reserve space for future storage variables and prevent storage collisions. This is a common practice to ensure compatibility and avoid issues when upgrading the contract in the future. Consider including following line in the contract: 

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
