# Vesting.sol uses incorrect initializer modifier

### Summary

vesting.sol is a contract intended to be inherited by SymmVesting and its initializer should not use the initializer modfier
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76) it should use the onlyinitializing modifer

### Root Cause

in the vesting.sol contract for intializing the contract it uses intializer modifier this is incorrect for contracts like vesting.sol which is meant to be inherited  
by symmvesting

in this inheritance chain. the symmvesting also has its own initialize function, which includes the initializer modifier and calls the initialize function of vesting.sol.  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L65

The problem here is that both the parent contract vesting.sol and child contracts symmvesting are using the initializer modifier which limits the initalization to only one call

the openzeppelin docs state that https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer-- onlyinitializing modifier should be used to allow initialization in both the parent and child contracts the onlyinitializing modifier 

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-onlyInitializing-- 
 ensures that when the initialize function is called, any contracts in its inheritance chain can still complete their own initialization.

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer--

" A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once. In its scope, onlyInitializing functions can be used to initialize parent contracts."

### Internal Pre-conditions

intializing contracts

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

not an attack

### Impact

While this scenario doesn't pose a direct financial threat or enable an exploit, it introduces a major operational risk. The vulnerability can prevent inheriting contracts from completing their initialization, potentially causing deployment failures for essential protocol components and impacting overall system functionality

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

replace the initializer modifier in the vesting.sol with onlyinitializing modifier
