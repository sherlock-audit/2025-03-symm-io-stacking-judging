# [H-01] Potential Token Amount Truncation in Permit2 Approval

## Summary
Token amounts may be truncated when cast to uint160, leading to insufficient approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail
SymmVesting.sol:185-188 casts token amounts to uint160 when approving them via the PERMIT2 contract, 
Code reference: [SymmVesting.sol#L185-L188](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L185-L187)
which could truncate large values.

## Impact
Failed transactions or reduced liquidity addition due to truncated approval amounts.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks to ensure the values don't exceed the maximum uint160 before casting.
