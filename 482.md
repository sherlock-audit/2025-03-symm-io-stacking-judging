# Lack of `_disableInitializers` in SymmVesting Contract Poses Security Risk.


### Summary:
The Symmetric Vesting Contract does not implement the `_disableInitializers` function in its constructor, which is recommended in OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation to prevent the uninitialized contract from being exploited. An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may allow them to alter the contract's behavior and potentially control the proxy. This poses a security risk to the entire contract system, as the protocol need to stick with upgradeable contract implementation.

### Root Cause:
- **Absence of `_disableInitializers`**: The contract does not invoke the `_disableInitializers` function in its constructor, leaving the implementation contract potentially uninitialized.
- **Uninitialized Implementation Contract**: OpenZeppelin contracts recommend calling `_disableInitializers` in the constructor to lock the contract and prevent it from being used again after deployment. If this step is missed, attackers could exploit the uninitialized state.

### Mitigation:
1. **Add `_disableInitializers` in Constructor**: To lock the implementation contract immediately after deployment, invoke the `_disableInitializers()` function inside the constructor of the vesting contract.
   ```solidity
   constructor() {
       _disableInitializers();  // Ensures the contract cannot be re-initialized
   }
   ```
   
2. **Implement Upgradeable Contracts Safeguards**: Ensure that all upgradeable contracts follow the OpenZeppelin guidelines and properly lock initialization after deployment to prevent potential exploits.
