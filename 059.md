# State inconsistencies will happen because of ERC20 Transfer Issues: Using transfer Instead of safeTransfer.

### Summary

The contract uses IERC20(token).transfer for token transfers, which may not handle tokens that do not return a boolean value upon transfer. This can lead to silent failures or reverts when interacting with non-compliant ERC20 tokens.

### Root Cause

By directly calling transfer instead of using SafeERC20â€™s safeTransfer function, the contract bypasses built-in checks that ensure the transfer was successful  and transfer might fail silently or revert unexpectedly.



### Internal Pre-conditions

`_claimUnlockedToken` is called and `IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);` try to transfer tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

A user calls claim functions to receive tokens.

The transfer call fails (or returns no value) due to token non-compliance.

The function reverts, denying the claim.

### Impact

-> Inside `_claimUnlockedToken` function 

Token transfer fails and transaction ( token transfer ) is reverted which denies transfer and tokens stays in contract , but 

`totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;` 

and 

`vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;`

variables is updated assuming that tokens are not there which leads to incorrect accounting.

-> Inside `_claimLockedToken` function
```solidity 

// Adjust the vesting plan
vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
totalVested[token] -= amount;
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

```
user's vesting position is updated but tokens are not transferred , which will result in loss of funds for users .

	


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library and modify lines for example.

```solidity

IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

```
