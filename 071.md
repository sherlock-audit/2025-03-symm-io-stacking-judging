# Missing _disableInitializers() in the constructor

### Summary

Contracts `Vesting.sol` and `SymmStaking.sol` are initializable, upgradeable Smart Contracts, which means they must have `_disableInitializers()` in their constructor. 

### Root Cause

Because the contracts are upgradeable, they must have `_disableinitializers()` constructor to prevent re-initialization of the contract, meaning anyone can pass whatever arguments they want into the `initialize()` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

Malicious user reinitializes contract to modify state.


### Impact

An attacker can make himself the admin of the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Invoke the `_disableInitializers()` function in the constructor.
