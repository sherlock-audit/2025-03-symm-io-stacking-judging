# Precision Loss in Reward Rate Calculation Leading to Undistributed Rewards

### Summary

A precision loss issue in `_addRewardsForToken` leads to **undistributed rewards** when calculating the reward rate. In a scenario where **12.000000 USDT** is deposited for distribution over **1 week**, only **11.491198 USDT** is distributed, leaving **0.508802 USDT undistributed** (~4.24% loss). This issue is more pronounced for tokens with lower decimals. Additionally, this leftover amount remains in `pendingRewards`, which prevents the removal of the reward token from `rewardTokens` array due to an existing check requiring `pendingRewards < 10`.

### Root Cause

1. **Integer Division in** 
    -   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370
    - Solidity performs **integer division**, which discards decimals when dividing `amount / duration`.
    - This causes a loss of precision in the calculated rate, leading to **less reward distributed** than intended.

2. **Accumulation of `pendingRewards`**

    - Because of precision loss, not all rewards are properly distributed, leaving a small leftover balance in `pendingRewards`.
    - Since `pendingRewards[token] > 10`, the token cannot be removed from `rewardTokens[]`. causing continous growth.

### Impact

- **Users receive less than the expected rewards**, which affects the fairness of the staking system.
- **Tokens with lower decimals suffer more from this issue**, as rounding errors increase with fewer decimal places.
- The inability to remove tokens from `rewardTokens` leads to an inefficiency. As multiple rewards are used their may e need to reshuffle the reward list by adding new tokens and removing prev tokens. however, this will cannot be done because of the `pendingRewards` being greater tha 0. hence, this will lead to contraint where by
   i - Manager cannot add new token rewards to prevent overgrowth. and hence rewards from new token is impossible
   ii - Manager are forced to add more tokens. and then make `rewardTokens` length exceed 10 - 20. and if this addition continues, gas cost to call `_updateRewardsStates` keeps increasing as unnecessarily as the function iterates through `rewardTokens`.

  	const user2BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
  	await symmStaking.connect(user2).claimRewards()
  	const user2BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
  	const user2Claimed = user2BalanceAfter - user2BalanceBefore
  
  	const pendingRewards = await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdtToken.getAddress())
  
  	console.log(user1Claimed + user2Claimed, pendingRewards)
  
  	// Log result =  11.491,198, 508802
  
  	//11,491,198 is approximately 4.24% less than 12,000,000
  })
```

### Mitigation

Use fixed-point arithmetic with higher precision
```diff
- state.rate = amount / state.duration
+ state.rate = (amount * 1e18) / state.duration;
```
