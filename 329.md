# Wrong assumption in `_addLiquidityProcess` may lead to user receiving less tokens than he should

### Summary

This is due to the following line of code in the `_addLiquidityProcess` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L124

```solidity
	function _addLiquidityProcess(
		uint256 amount,
		uint256 minLpAmount,
		uint256 maxUsdcIn
	) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
		// Claim any unlocked SYMM tokens first.
		_claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender);

		VestingPlan storage symmVestingPlan = vestingPlans[SYMM][msg.sender];
		uint256 symmLockedAmount = symmVestingPlan.lockedAmount();
		if (symmLockedAmount < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

		_ensureSufficientBalance(SYMM, amount);

		// Add liquidity to the pool.
		(amountsIn, lpAmount) = _addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);

		// Update SYMM vesting plan by reducing the locked amount.
@>		symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);

```

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is the fact that it is checked if the inputed amount is greater than the current lock but after the liquidity provision, the lock is decreased with ` amountsIn[0]`, which will lead to small amount of `SYMM` remaining in the lock. This amount may be small on itself and will lead to receiving 0 `SYMMLP` tokens but in combination with the other tokens from the lock it may actually make some difference 

### Internal Pre-conditions

`_addLiquidityProcess` function is called 

### External Pre-conditions

The returned `amountsIn[0]` to be less than the inputed `amount`

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users remaining `SYMM` locks will be rendered useless because they can't mint any lp tokens, while if used in the first liquidity provision, they can make some difference 

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Check if the vested amount is lower than the returned `amountsIn[0]` amount and then subtract it
