# `Vesting::_claimLockedToken()` should round up to prevent attacker not paying fees

### Summary

`Vesting::_claimLockedToken()` [rounds down](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290) when calculating fees. Base gas price is very low at times, so for example using `100_000` gas costs around `0.00054*100_000*1e-9*3000 = 0.000162 USD on 24 Jan 2025. If the token is high valued per wei, it could be worth it to claim 1 wei at a time and not pay any penalty. For example, bitcoin wei costs about `1e-8*100000 = 0.01 USD`, 100 times bigger than the gas cost.

### Root Cause

In `Vesting:290`, penalty is rounded down.

### Internal Pre-conditions

High valued wei token is used.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker claims 1 wei locked at once and pays no fees.

### Impact

Loss of fees for protocol.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Round up.
