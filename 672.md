# lock of funds  Through Vesting Plan Reduction

### Summary

The [`resetAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71) function in the VestingPlan struct has a vulnerability where tokens can become permanently trapped in the contract when a vesting plan is reset to a lower amount. While the function correctly updates internal vesting parameters, it does not handle the excess tokens, leaving them stranded within the contract without a mechanism for withdrawal. This results in a permanent loss of recoverable funds.



### Root Cause

When resetting a vesting plan to a lower amount, the function updates the vesting planâ€™s state but does not transfer the excess tokens back to an external address or make them accessible:
```javascript
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    // Rebase the vesting plan from now.
    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    self.amount = amount;
    self.claimedAmount = 0;
    return self;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

An action is triggered and is reseting the amount for a user to a new lesser amount than the current one

### External Pre-conditions

//

### Attack Path

1. User A has 100,000 tokens in a vesting plan.
- The contract holds these tokens on their behalf.
2. The admin decides to reduce the vesting amount to 80,000 tokens.
- They call resetAmount(vestingPlan, 80_000).
3.The function updates the vesting plan but does not release the extra 20,000 tokens.
- The contract still holds 100,000 tokens, even though only 80,000 are needed.
- The extra 20,000 tokens are stuck in the contract.

4. There is no way to claim or withdraw them, causing a permanent loss of funds.

### Impact

This vulnerability results in a permanent loss of recoverable funds. Over time, a significant amount of tokens could become stranded within the contract, reducing overall token efficiency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an Admin Withdrawal Mechanism
