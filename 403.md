# DOS in Reward Claims Due to USDC Blocklist

### Summary
The reward claiming mechanism can be permanently blocked for a user if they are blocklisted on any of the reward tokens (like USDC), preventing them from claiming any rewards, including other non-blocklisted tokens.

### Vulnerability Details
In `SymmStaking::_claimRewardsFor` function, rewards are distributed in a single loop that processes all reward tokens sequentially. If a user is blocklisted on `USDC` (which is mentioned as a potential reward token in the `README`), the `USDC` transfer will revert, causing the entire transaction to fail. This prevents the user from claiming any other rewards, as they cannot skip the blocked token.

From `README`:
> Only whitelisted tokens can work with the codebase, and these include stable-coins such as USDC, USDT, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM.

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[user][token] = 0;
            pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
            //@audit dos if token is USDC and user is blocklisted
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
            emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

### Impact
Users blocklisted on USDC cannot claim any rewards

### Recommendation
Check if one of the tokens is USDC, and if so, check if the user is blocklisted, if yes, continue without revert
