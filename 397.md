# A Wrong Required USDC Amount is Returned from the Liquidity Quote Function While Attempting to Add Liquidity

### Summary

The `getLiquidityQuote` function is designed to calculate the amount of USDC required and the expected LP tokens for a given SYMM amount based on pool balances. However, due to an incorrect conversion factor, the USDC amount is scaled down improperly. Because USDC has 6 decimals and SYMM has 18 decimals, the subsequent multiplication by `1e18` and division by `1e30` reduces the USDC amount far below the correct value which may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect liquidity provisioning.

### Root Cause

After computing [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L253):

```solidity
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```

the function applies [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L254):

```solidity
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```

This extra conversion leads to a dramatically lower number than expected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `symmAmount` is expressed in 18 decimals (e.g., `1e18` for `1 SYMM`).
2. `symmBalance` is in 18 decimals, while `usdcBalance` is in 6 decimals.
3. The initial calculation produces a USDC amount in 6 decimals.
4. The conversion using `_mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30)` further divides the value, causing the error.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The external pool returns balances with USDC in 6 decimals and SYMM in 18 decimals.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `addLiquidity()` with a given `symmAmount`,which later relies on `getLiquidityQuote()` to get the `usdcIn` amount
2. The function calculates a raw USDC amount using `(symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance`.
3. The additional conversion multiplies by `1e18` and divides by `1e30`, effectively dividing the raw USDC amount by `1e12`.
4. As a result, the returned USDC amount is significantly lower than the true value, misleading the user about the liquidity requirements.

### Impact

The Liquidity Quote function is not reliable. Users receive an erroneously low liquidity quote for USDC, potentially leading them to approve or spend less USDC than required when attempting to add liquidity.

### PoC

Assuming that:
`symmAmount = 1e18` (1 SYMM),
`symmBalance = 1e20` (100 SYMM),
`usdcBalance = 1e12` (1,000,000 USDC).

Then:
Raw USDC calculation: `(1e18 * 1e12) / 1e20 = 1e10` (i.e., 10,000 USDC).
Conversion: `_mulDivUp(1e10, 1e18, 1e30) â‰ˆ 1e10 / 1e12 = 0.01` (rounded to 1 wei).
Thus, the function returns ~1 wei.

A test contract has been set up on remix in order to confirm this. Copy the code below, deploy it, and pass `1e18` as you call the function in remix. Notice that the `usdcAmount` returned is equal to 1.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Test {
    error ZeroDivision();

    function overwrite(uint256 symmAmount)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 usdcAmount)
    {
        uint256 symmBalance = 1e20; // 100 SYMM
        uint256 usdcBalance = 1e12; //1,000,000 usdc
        usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
        usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
    }

    function _mulDivUp(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
		if (c == 0) revert ZeroDivision();
		uint256 product = a * b;
		assembly ("memory-safe") {
			result := mul(iszero(iszero(product)), add(div(sub(product, 1), c), 1))
		}
	}
}
```

### Mitigation

Remove the extra conversion step (`_mulDivUp`) or adjust the scaling factors so that the correct USDC value is preserved.
