# Tokens will be stuck in SymmStaking contracts because of precision loss when calculating reward rate

### Summary

Due to precision loss when calculating the `rewardRate` in the rewards, reward tokens will accumulate and be left stuck.

### Root Cause

When rewards are deposited in `notifyRewardAmount`, the `rewardRate` in `_addRewardsForToken`  for the deposited `amount` will be either calculated for the first time or recalculated if there have already been deposited rewards for that token and their periodFinish hasn't elapsed yet.

In any case though, there'll be a precision loss when dividing the rewards by the duration:
```js
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp; 
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; 
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
Because the reward token (amount) has 6 decimals while the duration (state.duration) is a large integer (604,800 seconds), the division truncates the fractional part, causing precision loss. Over multiple reward periods, this small loss accumulates into a significant amount of unclaimable tokens.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The reward token must have 6 decimals.


### External Pre-conditions

The `notifyRewardAmount` must be called to distribute rewards.

### Attack Path

**Case 1: The current period has finished or never started**
- Reward: 1,000,000,000 (1000e6)
- Rewards Duration: 604,800 seconds (7 days)
- Calculated Reward Rate: 1,653
- Rechecking: rewardRate * rewardsDuration = 999,734,400
- Precision Loss: 265600 

**Case 2: The current period has not finished yet**
- Remaining Time: 302,400 seconds (half of rewards duration)
- Leftover: remaining * rewardRate = 499,800,000
- New Reward Rate Calculation: (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration = 2,479
- Rechecking: newRewardRate * rewardsDuration = 1,499,432,000
- Precision Loss: Leftover + Reward = 1,499,800,000, making 568000 precision loss (0.568 USDC)


This precision loss means that, over time, small amounts of reward tokens will accumulate and become stuck in the contract. The fewer decimals the reward token has, the larger the precision loss becomes.

### Impact

Over time, an increasing number of reward tokens become unclaimable due to precision loss.
