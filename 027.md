# [H-02] Unvalidated Token Order Assumption in Balancer Pool Interactions

## Summary
Unvalidated Token Order Assumption in Balancer Pool Interactions creates a vulnerability to token order changes.

## Vulnerability Detail
SymmVesting.sol:82-84 assumes a specific token order in the Balancer pool without validation.
Code reference: [SymmVesting.sol#L82-L84](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L82-L84)

## Impact
If the token order in the Balancer pool changes, the contract will interact with incorrect tokens, potentially leading to failed transactions or loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Hardcoded token order assumption
SYMM = _symm;
USDC = _usdc;
SYMM_LP = _symm_lp;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Query the pool for the correct token order at runtime instead of assuming a fixed order, or implement a validation mechanism to ensure the expected token order.
