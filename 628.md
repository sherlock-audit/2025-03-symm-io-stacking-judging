# _setupVestingPlans can cause incorrect vesting records

### Summary

The `_setupVestingPlans` function does not validate the amounts parameter, which allows setting vesting amounts that do not match actual token balances. As a result, totalVested records incorrect values, which can break functions relying on this variable.

### Root Cause

In [`Vesting.sol:204`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L204) , the function `_setupVestingPlans` directly adds `amounts[i]` to `totalVested[token]` without verifying if the contract actually holds the specified tokens. If an excessively large amount is set, totalVested will become inaccurate, potentially causing logical inconsistencies in functions that depend on it.

```solidity
	function _setupVestingPlans(address token, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
@>			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
@>			totalVested[token] += amount;
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
			vestingPlan.setup(amount, startTime, endTime);
			emit VestingPlanSetup(token, user, amount, startTime, endTime);
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `SETTER_ROLE` calls setupVestingPlans with an unreasonably high amount, `totalVested` is updated with this incorrect value.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.	An admin with `SETTER_ROLE` calls `setupVestingPlans`, assigning an excessively large amount to a user.
2.	The contract updates totalVested with this incorrect value, significantly inflating the recorded vesting amount.
3.	When a user tries to claim tokens (e.g., by calling `claimLockedToken`), the contract logic may revert due to the mismatch between totalVested and actual balances.
4.	The protocol’s vesting logic becomes unreliable, potentially blocking legitimate claims and causing disruptions.

### Impact

- The protocol’s `totalVested` value no longer reflects actual token balances.
- Functions that rely on `totalVested`, such as token claims, may fail, leading to a protocol malfunction.
- Users may be unable to retrieve their vested tokens due to incorrect calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement a validation check to ensure the provided `amounts[i]` values do not exceed the contract’s available token balance.
- Before updating `totalVested`, verify that the contract has enough tokens to support the assigned amounts.
- Require that `setupVestingPlans` only allows adding new vesting plans when the contract holds the corresponding tokens.
