# Missing `disableinitializers()` in constructor can lead to malicious takeover of the implementation contract.

## Summary
SymmStaking.sol does not disable initilizer which allows a third party to become the owner of this implementation contract.

## Root Cause
SymmStaking.sol is one of the implementation contracts that the `Proxy` will point to once the `proxy` gets deployed. Since `SymmStaking.sol` does not disable initializers in its constructor, this opens the possibility for a third party to make himself/herself owner of the `SymmStaking.sol` by calling [SymmStaking::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L153).

```sol
// File: token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol

// @audit-issue
function initialize(address admin, address _stakingToken) external initializer {
		__AccessControlEnumerable_init();
		__ReentrancyGuard_init();
		__Pausable_init();

		if (admin == address(0) || _stakingToken == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

		stakingToken = _stakingToken;

		_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, admin);
	}
```

## Impact
Implementation can get destroyed, compromising future updates.

## mitigation

To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the `_disableInitializers()` function from Openzeppelin in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:


```diff
+   constructor() {
+		_disableInitializers();
+	}
```
