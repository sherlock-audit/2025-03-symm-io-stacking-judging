# [M-01] Paused State Bypass for `configureRewardToken` allows whitelisting/unwhitelisting reward tokens while contract is expected to be paused

### Summary

The function `configureRewardToken` in `SymmStaking.sol` does not enforce the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing it to execute even when the contract is paused. This could lead to modifications to the staking reward token whitelist while interactions are expected to be frozen.

### Root Cause

- `configureRewardToken` does not have `whenNotPaused` modifier:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **The contract's `paused` variable must be `true`**, indicating that interactions should be disabled.
2. **The function `configureRewardToken` must lack the `whenNotPaused` modifier**, allowing execution despite the contract being paused.
3. **Admin** needs to **call `configureRewardToken`** to set `{token}` as **whitelisted or removed** while the contract is paused.
4. **At least one reward token must be present in the whitelist**.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **The contract must have been paused** by an admin or governance action.
2. **The protocol must be in a state where pausing is necessary** (e.g., an emergency, security exploit, or migration).
3. **The protocol must rely on pausing as a security control**, assuming that important functions are disabled while paused.

### Attack Path

1. **Admin** calls `configureRewardToken(token, status)` while contract is paused.

### Impact

By bypassing the paused state:
- **`configureRewardToken`** can modify the reward tokens whitelist while the contract is paused, potentially affecting staking logic when no changes should be allowed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier to function.
