# Attacker will steal funds from users.

## Summary

`expectedLpAmount` is calculated using `getLiquidityQuote()` function that calculates the amount using pool's current balances and pool's totalSupply, which is done at the time of transaction execution, this allows an attacker to sandwich `addLiquidity` call to manipulate pool balances and extract value from users.

## Root Cause

Calculating `expectedLpAmount` and subsequently using it to calculate `minLpAmountWithSlippage` at transaction execution time rather than accepting it as a parameter.

```solidity
(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);
```

[SymmVesting.sol#L177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L177)
```solidity
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100;
```
## Internal Pre-conditions

1. **User Action:** A user calls a function that adds liquidity to a pool.
2. **On-chain Calculation:** The contract calculates `expectedLpAmount` based on the current pool state at execution time.
3. **Slippage Check:** The contract uses `expectedLpAmount` as both the expected output and as the basis for slippage protection.

## External Pre-conditions

None

## Attack Path

1. **User submits a transaction** to add liquidity to the pool.
2. **Attacker observes the pending transaction** in the mempool.
3. **Attacker executes a front-run transaction** that manipulates the pool balances.
4. **User's transaction executes**, calculating `expectedLpAmount` based on the now-manipulated pool state.
5. **Slippage check passes** because it's based on the manipulated state.
6. **Attacker executes a back-run transaction** to extract value from the manipulated pool state.
7. **User receives fewer LP tokens** than they would have in a fair market.

## Impact

The users receives less LP tokens for their SYMM and USDC.
## PoC

See above

## Mitigation

Accept a user-provided `minLpAmount` parameter that specifies the minimum acceptable LP tokens to receive.
