# Malicious user can claim full amount immediately if VestingPlan is misconfigured

### Summary

If `VestingPlan.startTime` and `VestingPlan.endTime` are misconfigured using wrong values i.e. `startTime` is greater than `endTime` then malicious user will be able to claim the fully vested amount immediately after the vesting plan is setup.

Edit/Update:
I just thought of another perspective of this report, so I am updating this report. Originally I wrote this report with the scenario in mind that by mistake, `endTime` is set as `startTime` and `startTime` as `endTime`. But there is another angle to this issue. By mistake `endTime` can be set as a past timestamp. In this case immediately after the vesting plan is setup, users will be able to claim the full amount.

### Root Cause

In [Vesting::_setupVestingPlan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L204C2-L215C3) function, there is no check implemented to validate that `startTime` is not greater than or equal to `endTime`. Although [Vesting::setupVestingPlans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L133C2-L141C3) is protected by `onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE)` modifier, but there is always chances of mistakes that cannot be ignored.

If somehow, `VestingPlan` is misconfigured wrongly as mentioned above, an attacker can immediately wipe out its share of tokens.

Lets assume that a VestingPlan for a user is setup as below
- startTime = 10
- endTime = 5
- amount = 500

The malicious user will call [Vesting::claimUnlockedToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L145C2-L147C3) function, this will internally call `_claimUnlockedToken` function, which will further call `vestingPlan.claimable` function, which will further call `unlockedAmount` function. Now `unlockedAmount` function will return the full amount as below

```solidity
	function unlockedAmount(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
                //// currentTime = 9

		if (currentTime >= self.endTime) return self.amount;
                //// 9 >= 5

		if (currentTime <= self.startTime) return 0;
		uint256 duration = self.endTime - self.startTime;
		uint256 elapsed = currentTime - self.startTime;
		return (self.amount * elapsed) / duration;
	}
```

Then in `_claimUnlockedToken` function, full amount will be assigned to `claimableAmount` variable which is then transferred to `user` as below

```solidity
	function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();
                 //// claimableAmount = 500        <@ BUG

		totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
		vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);

		IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);        <@ FUNDS SENT

		emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. While setting up a vesting plan, `endTime` is set smaller than `startTime`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Current timestamp is greater than or even equal to misconfigured `endTime`

### Attack Path

1. Vesting plan is setup wrongly with `startTime` being greater than `endTime`
2. Malicious user claims full amount

### Impact

A malicious user will be able to claim his full amount before being vested as per the logic of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

While setting up a vesting plan, there should be a check in place to ensure that `endTime` is always greater than `startTime` and `startTime` should always be greater than or equal to current timestamp. Or even a decent and standard interval can also be imposed between these two time ranges.
