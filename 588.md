# Reward Rate Rounding to Zero in SymmStaking Contract causes loss of rewards for users

### Summary

The `_addRewardsForToken` function in the SymmStaking contract is vulnerable to a rounding issue where the reward rate can be set to zero due to integer division. This occurs when the reward amount is less than the duration period, causing the division to round down to zero. Once the rate is set to zero, rewards effectively stop accruing for users, breaking core contract functionality.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from Solidity's integer division behavior, which truncates decimal results. In the `_addRewardsForToken` function, the reward rate is calculated by dividing the reward amount by the duration:

`state.rate = amount / state.duration;`

or in the case of an ongoing reward period:

`state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;`


If `amount` (or `amount + leftover`) is less than `state.duration`, the division will result in zero, effectively stopping reward distribution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract uses integer division to calculate reward rates
No minimum check is implemented for reward amounts
The `state.duration` value is sufficiently large (e.g., measured in seconds for a week or month)

### External Pre-conditions

User adds a reward value that causes rate to round down to zero

### Attack Path

1. There are two main scenarios where this vulnerability can be exploited:
Initial reward setup:
	- An attacker or mistaken admin adds a reward amount that is less than the duration
	- Example: If duration is 604,800 (1 week in seconds) and amount is 604,000 tokens
	- Result: state.rate = 604,000 / 604,800 = 0 due to integer division
2. Subsequent reward additions:
	- For an ongoing reward period, if amount + leftover is less than state.duration
	- Example: If there are 100,000 tokens leftover, duration is 604,800, and a new amount of 504,700 is added
	- Result: state.rate = (504,700 + 100,000) / 604,800 = 604,700 / 604,800 = 0
	- Once the rate is set to zero, all stakers will stop receiving rewards until a new, sufficiently large reward amount is added.

### Impact

1. Stakers receive no rewards despite tokens being added to the contract
2. Loss of funds for the protocol as rewards are effectively locked
3. Undermines trust in the staking mechanism
4. May lead to mass unstaking if users notice they aren't receiving rewards

### PoC

```Typescript
it.only("Reward rate rounds down to ZeroPOC", async function () {
			// Give user2 some USDT
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2.address, 604800)

			const depositAmount = "604800" // user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM
			const rewardAmount = "604800" // Total reward for 7 days

			// user1 deposits tokens
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			// Admin configures and notifies rewards
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			// Fast forward time to accumulate some rewards
			await time.increase(302400)

			// More rewards added to incentivise staking
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 302400)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [302400])

			// Fast forward time to the end of the new reward period
			await time.increase(302400)

			// User 1 claims rewards at the end of the initial period
			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)

			// The claimed rewards should be 604800 (all of first reward) + 151200 (half of the second reward) = 756000
			console.log("First claimed rewards: ", user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore) // actual 302400

			await time.increase(302400) // got to end of both rewards

			const user1BalanceBefore1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)

			// The claimed rewards should be 151200 the remaining half of the second reward
			// expect(user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1).to.equal(rewardAmount)
			console.log("Second claimed rewards:", user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1) // actual 0
		})
```

### Mitigation

```Solidity
// Use a scaling factor to preserve precision
uint256 constant RATE_PRECISION = 1e18;

function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
    
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = (amount * RATE_PRECISION) / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = ((amount * RATE_PRECISION) + leftover) / state.duration;
    }
    
    require(state.rate > 0, "Reward rate cannot be zero");
    
    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```
