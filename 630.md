# Issue in Reward Distribution for Users Re-depositing into Staking Contract


### **Summary:**
The current logic of reward distribution in the staking contract is incorrect when users deposit tokens multiple times. The issue arises when a user deposits tokens, claims rewards, and then deposits additional tokens at a later time. The rewards are not being accurately calculated for the previous deposit, especially considering the duration the user has kept their assets in the contract. According to the contract documentation, users should be rewarded based on the length of time they have provided liquidity to the protocol, but the current implementation does not reflect this, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards.

### **Root Cause:**
Consider the following scenario:
1. **First Deposit**:  
   - The user deposits `100 tokens` when the contract starts, and at that moment, `totalSupply == 0`.
   - `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = 0`.

   The user claims rewards after some time, and the `rewardPerToken` increases to `10`. The rewards calculation is as follows:  
   - `calculatedRewards = 100 * (10 - 0) + 0 = 1000 tokens`.
   - The contract then sets `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = 10`.

2. **Second Deposit**:  
   - The user deposits an additional `100 tokens` later, and now the `total asset of user` becomes `200 tokens`.
   - At the time of the second deposit, `userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = 10`.
   
   After some more time, `rewardPerTokenStored` increases to `20`. However, when the user claims rewards for the second deposit, the reward calculation is as follows:  
   - `rewards = 200 * (20 - 10) + 0 = 2000 tokens`.  
   This calculation incorrectly rewards the user as if they had deposited all tokens at the same time, ignoring the fact that the user deposited the first 100 tokens earlier, thus providing liquidity for a longer duration.

   The issue is that the rewards for the initial 100 tokens are not properly accounted for based on the actual time the user has kept those tokens in the contract.

### **Impact:**
- **Unfair Reward Distribution**: Users who deposit tokens early and provide liquidity for longer durations will be unfairly rewarded. This is because, when they make additional deposits, the rewards for their earlier tokens are diluted and not properly adjusted based on the time they have been active in the protocol.
- **Loss of Incentive**: Legitimate users who have provided liquidity for longer periods will see reduced rewards, which may discourage them from continuing to participate in the staking contract.

### **Mitigation:**
- **Redesign Reward Logic**:  
  The reward distribution logic needs to be redesigned to properly account for the time each deposit has been in the contract. This could be achieved by tracking individual deposits and their corresponding reward accruals based on their specific durations in the contract.
  
- **Maintain Separate Tracking for Each Deposit**:  

  - **Reward Formula Adjustment**:  
    Instead of treating all deposits as one, the formula should factor in the timestamp of each deposit and calculate rewards accordingly, considering the duration each token has been staked.

  Example:
  ```solidity
  uint256 depositTime = depositTimestamps[account][depositIndex];
  uint256 duration = block.timestamp - depositTime;
  uint256 depositReward = balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) * duration;
  ```
