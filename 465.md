# Precision loss with rewards rate calculation

### Summary

Whenever new rewards are notified and deposited, the reward rate is calculated by dividing rewards amount by rewards distribution period, which is fixed to 1 weeks. However, exact precision of rewards rate is not handled except rewards token decimals, which causes precision loss in rate calculation.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) function, where it does not take additional precision into account when the token decimals are relatively small, e.g. USDC with 6 decimals.

Since 1 weeks = 604800 seconds, upto 0.6 USDC can be lost per depositing rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Rewards tokens with small decimals like USDC are registered.

### External Pre-conditions

New rewards have been deposited by calling `notifyRewardAmount`.

### Attack Path

- Assume, 100 USDC has been deposited as rewards through `notifyRewardAmount`.
- 100 USDC = 1e8, so rewards rate per second is 1e8 / 604800 = 165.
- 165 * 604800 = 99.792000, so 0.21 USDC is lost.

### Impact

For every deposit, there happens non-negligible loss happening because of precision loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The rewards rate mechanism has to be updated to have more than WAD decimals rather than token decimals that causes loss.
