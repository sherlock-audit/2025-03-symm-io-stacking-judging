# Issue H-3: Penalty Receiver Can Drain Funds via Malicious Token

### Summary

The claimLockedToken function transfers penalty amounts to the lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver without verifying if the receiver is a trusted address or checking for malicious contracts, creating a potential attack vector.

### Root Cause

State updates occur after external token transfers, and there are no restrictions on who can be set as the penalty receiver.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attacker with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE sets lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver to a malicious contract
User calls claimLockedToken to claim tokens
Penalty amount is transferred to the malicious receiver
Malicious contract implements callbacks that reenter claimLockedToken before state updates
Attacker can repeatedly claim the same locked tokens, draining the contract

### Impact

Complete loss of SYMM tokens held by the contract, compromising the entire vesting system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply checks-effects-interactions pattern by updating state before transfers
Restrict the penalty receiver to non-contract addresses or trusted contracts
Implement proper distribution logic as specified in documentation
