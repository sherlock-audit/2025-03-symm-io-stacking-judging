# Missing check for `reward <= pendingRewards[token]` in function `_claimRewardsFor()` .

### Summary

A missing check for the condition `reward <= pendingRewards[token]` will cause transaction reverts when users attempt to claim rewards if the contract's internal accounting (pendingRewards[token]) is insufficient to cover the calculated reward amount. 

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:395](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L392), function `_claimRewardsFor() `, the reward amount is deducted from `pendingRewards[token]` without checking if the reward is less than or equal to the value stored in `pendingRewards[token]`. 
```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user must have staked tokens and earned rewards in the contract.
2. Rewards for the given token must be notified and pending.
3. The contract state for `pendingRewards[token]` must contain a value .

### External Pre-conditions

1. No other external protocol interference, such as price oracle manipulation or gas spikes, should occur during reward claim.


### Attack Path

1. A user calls function `claimRewards` which calls function  `_claimRewardsFor`.
2. The contract computes the earned rewards for each token.
3. The contract attempts to deduct the earned reward from `pendingRewards[token]`.
4. Since there is no check for `reward <= pendingRewards[token]`, the contract may deducts a higher amount than available in the `pendingRewards` mapping.

### Impact

Failed Reward Claims: Users might experience transaction reverts when attempting to claim rewards if the contract's internal accounting (pendingRewards[token]) is insufficient to cover the calculated reward amount. This failure prevents users from receiving rewards they are entitled to.

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, you should add a check to ensure that `reward <= pendingRewards[token]` before deducting from `pendingRewards[token]`:
```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
                                if (reward > pendingRewards[token]) revert InsufficientBalance(pendingRewards[token], 
                                 reward);
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
