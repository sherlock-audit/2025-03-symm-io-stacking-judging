# Token unwhitelist is not handled properly

### Summary

when a token is unwhitelisted, the rewardState for that token is not cleared

this means that if the token is whitelisted again, it should just continue from where it left off

there is an issue with this however , users who deposit for the first time after the unwhitelisting wont have userRewardPerTokenPaid updated to the latest one before unwhitelist 



### Root Cause

inconsistent management of state 

### Internal Pre-conditions

contract was not paused during entire period of token unwhitelist 

### External Pre-conditions

token is unwhitelisted then later whitelisted again 

### Attack Path

tokenA is unwhitelisted with a perTokenStored of 1e12
bob deposits some staking token (since tokenA is not a rewardToken, his userRewardPerTokenPaid is not updated for tokenA) 
tokenA is whitelisted again 
bob immediately earns some rewards on tokenA even though no rewards have been added 



### Impact

1. users would be able to claim more tokens than they should 
2. users could be dosed from claiming other reward tokens if the excess token balance is not in the contract 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. create a seperate state to mark a reward token as unwhitelisted rather than removing it from the rewards array 
2. if a token has been marked as unwhitelisted then in _updateRewardsStates, ignore all other logic and simply set userRewardPerTokenPaid to the latest one
