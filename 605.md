# staker might not be able to claim any rewards, if usdc is reward token and staker is blacklisted

### Summary

In SymmStaking.sol, user can claim rewards ,using claimRewards() . and in which internally _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender) is called. 

So basically here, rewards can be claimed to the msg.sender, now real issue is , here all tokens rewards can be claimed with this function only, there is no claim rewards functionallity for single single token, or tokens they want to claim . Instead all rewards will be claimed collectively thorugh this function

We all know usdc is widely used tokens, and it can be definitely whitelisted token for rewards, if any staker by mistake got or anyhow got blacklisted , that user will not be able to claim all other tokens as rewards too.
