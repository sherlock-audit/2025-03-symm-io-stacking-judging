# RewardPerToken is incorrectly distributed

### Summary

In SymmStaking when token is whitelisted by calling ```configureRewardToken``` then funds are deposited to contract by calling ```notifyRewardAmount```(1). Users that have deposited start accruing rewards. However if someone calls  ```notifyRewardAmount```(1) to deposit more rewards for the same token In ```_addRewardsForToken```(2) notice how ```state.rate``` is calculated based on ```state.duration``` which is always 1 week meanwhile ```periodFinish``` gets updated with added time which becomes more than 1 week. What I want to say is that ```state.rate``` is calculated to distribute rewards exactly for 1 week, however when ```periodfinish``` changes bug occurs. Whenever ```_updateRewardsStates```(3) is called after those steps, In ```earned``` function which calculates how much user should receive, the formula calls ```rewardPerToken```(4) which calls ```lastTimeRewardApplicable```(5) where ```periodFinish``` is used as the last timestamp of the duration of accruing rewards. This means since ```state.rate``` is calculated to distribute the rewards for exactly 1 week after this 1 week and all rewards being distributed this function will continue updating and increasing ```rewards[account][token]``` rewards balance for the user until it reaches ```periodFinish```. Which will cause user being able to claim more than they actually should (if there are more tokens than expected in the contract or if first users claim this whole rewards amount which will leave the lasts without rewards or if  ```notifyRewardAmount``` has been called for other users). Or It will cause fake update of rewards state.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
		
	}
```

(2)
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; 
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;  //<-------
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; 
	}
```

```solidity
function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / 
				totalSupply);
	}
```

(5)
```solidity
function lastTimeRewardApplicable(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return block.timestamp < rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish ? block.timestamp : rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish;
	}
```

### Root Cause

The main cause that lets this bug happen is that   It always calculates state.rate with duration which is 1 week instead of calculating it with periodFinish.
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; 
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; 
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; 
	}
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

Someone needs to distribute at least 1 more time than the initial distributions for this bug to happen.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
		
	}
```

### Attack Path

Admin calls configureRewardToken to set a whitelisted token
Someone calls notifyRewardAmount which sets periodFinish to 1 week.
notifyRewardAmount  is called again which increases periodFinish  > 1 week

Now Users that accrue rewards for this token get all rewards that they wouldve gotten from rewards for 1 week and   then users continuous to accrue more rewards that they should not normally. 


### Impact

Users accrue more token rewards than they should
