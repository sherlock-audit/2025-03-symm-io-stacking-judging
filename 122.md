# Removing reward tokens can be obstructed

### Summary

An attacker can easily obstruct the admins and prevent them from removing/blacklisting rewards tokens.

### Root Cause

When admins want to [remove a reward token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312-L335), a check is made to ensure no more than 10 wei of pending rewards exist:

```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
	_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

	if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
	if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

	isRewardToken[token] = status;
	if (!status) {
@>		if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
		...
		}
	}
```

The protocol also [expects to work](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate) with USDC, USDT, USDE and SYMM tokens. Since SYMM tokens will be used in staking and vesting schedules, it's safe to assume USDC/USDT will be used as rewards tokens.

Since [`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234-L243) can be called on behalf of someone else, an attacker can deposit and stake a few tokens on behalf of an address that is blacklisted by USDC/USDT. The blacklisted address will begin accumulating rewards and 10 wei is obviously easy to accumulate.

Now, if the admins attempt to remove a token, it will revert since there are pending rewards in excess of 10 wei. And if the admins attempt to [claim the tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L302-L305) on behalf of the address in order to clear up the pending rewards and be able to remove the token, the call will fail when attempting to transfer USDC/USDT to the blacklisted address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. USDC/USDT as reward token

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits and stakes a few tokens on behalf of a blacklisted address so it starts accumulating rewards

### Impact

Attacker obstructs the protocol functionality and makes it so that reward tokens cannot be removed/blacklisted by admins
