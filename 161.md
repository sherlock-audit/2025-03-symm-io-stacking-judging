# Issue with the setup() function allowing startTime to be set in the past.

### Summary

The setup() function in the VestingPlanOps library allows the startTime to be set in the past. This could cause tokens to become unlocked immediately, bypassing the intended vesting schedule. [example here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L59)

### Root Cause

In the setup() function of the VestingPlanOps library, there is no validation to check if the startTime is in the past. If startTime is set to a value earlier than the current block.timestamp, tokens may be unlocked prematurely.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User or contract needs to call the setup() function from the VestingPlanOps library.
The startTime should be set to a timestamp earlier than the current block.timestamp (which could be a time in the past, regardless of how far in the past it is).

### External Pre-conditions

No external conditions are required for this issue to occur since itâ€™s based purely on internal library logic.

### Attack Path

1. The user or contract invokes the setup() function from the VestingPlanOps library, setting the startTime to a past timestamp (earlier than block.timestamp).
2. As the startTime is in the past, the vesting plan would immediately unlock tokens, bypassing the intended lock-up period.
3. The user or contract can access unlocked tokens and bypass the vesting schedule.

### Impact

Users could potentially unlock their tokens immediately, which circumvents the vesting mechanism.
