# Prevent accrual of rewards when paused

### Summary

The notifyrewardamount function will revert when trying to add rewards when the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol the [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) is used to add rewards.
The function has a whenNotPaused modifier meaning the function can only be called when the contract is not paused.
This modifier is used properly for other functions, but it shouldn't be used for notifyrewardamount as it will revert and prevent external calls for adding reward from being added when the contract is paused.
User will lose rewards even though they hold tokens and should be receiving rewards.

    function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner pauses the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

External calls to add reward fails.

### Attack Path

- Owner pauses contract.
- External call to notifyRewardAmount to add rewards fails.
- Users lose rewards they are entitled to.

### Impact

Users lose rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the whenNotPaused modifier from notifyRewardAmount function.
