# rewardRate can be reduced and delayed by adding dust amount.

### Summary

The rewardRate of a token can be reduced by calling the notifyRewardAmount with dust amount. Also distribution can be delayed due to a call to [_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L289) where [state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378). 

### Root Cause

Since the notifyRewardAmount function doesn't have any access control, anyone can call the function. 
The notifyRewardAmount takes in an array of token addresses and the amount of reward to add. The amount gets transferred from the msg.sender, the amount gets added to [pendingRewards[token] += amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L288) and the function calls [_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L289) 

    function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}

In _addRewardsForToken if the timestamp is less than the periodFinish it updates the rate and at the end it extends the periodFinish to `block.timestamp + state.duration;` 
A malicious user can call the notifyRewardAmount with dust amounts to [pass the check in notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L284) to manipulate the rate and extend the periodFinish by state.duration.
Consider the following scenario:
- The rate is to distribute 10000 reward / 10 days. Meaning 1000 rewards a day.
- After 1 (after 10% of the duration) day a malicious user calls notifyRewardAmount with dust amount such as 1 reward.
- This causes the state.rate to be (1 + 9000)/10 which caused the rate to decrease by 10%.
- After 1 more day the attacker can call notifyRewardAmount and decrease the rate by another 10% and extend periodFinish by duration.
- A malicious user can do this indefinitely and reduce the rate as well as extend the state.periodFinish and grief other users.



### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:
- The rate is to distribute 10000 reward / 10 days. Meaning 1000 rewards a day.
- After 1 (after 10% of the duration) day a malicious user calls notifyRewardAmount with dust amount such as 1 reward.
- This causes the state.rate to be (1 + 9000)/10 which caused the rate to decrease by 10%.
- After 1 more day the attacker can call notifyRewardAmount and decrease the rate by another 10% and extend periodFinish by duration.
- A malicious user can do this indefinitely and reduce the rate as well as extend the state.periodFinish an grief other users.

### Impact

The reward rate can be decreased and the periodFinish will be extended by `duration` which cause reduced reward for depositors and distribution can be delayed indefinitely.



### Mitigation

Require a minimum reward amount to be deposited.
