# A user can abuse notifyRewardAmount() and dilute rewards for everyone

### Summary

Method `notifyRewardAmount()` is used to add rewards to an ongoing campaign or start a new campaign. If there is an ongoing campaign then it gets extended by 1 week. The reward rate gets recalculated as per new + undistributed rewards. But it can be abused by anyone to dilute the rewards by extending the campaign, hence decreasing the reward rate per second.

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

@>		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@>		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the campaign is extended everytime someone add rewards to an ongoing campaign.

### Attack Path

The protocol creates a campaign to distribute 700 USDC for a 1 week. Which means the stakers will get 100 USDC per day. Now, On 2nd day a user called `notifyRewardAmount()` with just 1 wei. Now, the campaign period changes from 6 to 7 again. So, the remaining 600 USDC will now be distributed in 7 days. Which decreases the reward rate to 85.5 USDC per day. 

This way a user causes the decrease in reward rate with just 1 wei causing harm to every staker as now the stakers will have to stake for an extra day to get the same rewards. 

This way a malicious user can keep extending the campaign and keep diluting rewards further and further.

### Impact

All the stakers are impacted  as their reward rate decreases. A malicious user can keep extending the campaign every day. Hence, decreasing the reward rate more everyday.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either allow trusted roles to access `notifyRewardAmount()` or don't extend the existing campaign when new rewards are added.
