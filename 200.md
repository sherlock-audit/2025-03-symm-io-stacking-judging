# Incorrect validation in `_resetVestingPlans()`

### Summary

In the [`Vesting.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222-L237) contract, when resetting a user's vesting plan using the `resetVestingPlans()` function, the inner function `_resetVestingPlans()` is triggered. This function incorrectly validates the new amount against the unlocked tokens (total tokens available for withdrawal) instead of the already claimed tokens.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];

			//@audit - amount should be compared with claimed amount not unlocked amount
			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```

The code checks if the new amount is less than the unlockedAmount(). But that's not the right metric to use here.

```solidity
function unlockedAmount(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
		if (currentTime >= self.endTime) return self.amount;
		if (currentTime <= self.startTime) return 0;
		uint256 duration = self.endTime - self.startTime;
		uint256 elapsed = currentTime - self.startTime;
		return (self.amount * elapsed) / duration;
	}
```

```solidity
struct VestingPlan {
	uint256 amount;
	uint256 claimedAmount;
	uint256 startTime;
	uint256 endTime;
}
```

`unlockedAmount()` represents the total amount that has become available to for the users to claim over time based on the vesting schedule. The `unlockedAmount()` might not have been claimed by the user. In the `VestingPlan` struct, the parameter `claimedAmount` represents how much the user has claimed.

The amount shouldn't be compared to `unlockedAmount` because its possible for the new amount to be greater than or equal to the `claimedAmount` but less than the `unlockedAmount()`, which should be allowed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

New `amount` to be set by admin is greater than or equal to `claimedAmount` but less than `unlockedAmount()`



### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

### Scenario
 
- Lets assume current total vesting plan is `amount = 100`, `unlockedAmount() = 70`and `claimedAmount = 60`
- Admin resets amount to `65`. The new amount(`65`) is less than the `unlockedAmount` but greater than the `claimedAmount`
- The function will revert with error `AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis()` which is wrong because the user has only claimed `60` tokens. It shouldn't revert because the user cant claim more than `(65 -60) 5` tokens more.

### Impact

I consider this a medium severity because admins cannot reduce totals to values between `claimedAmount` and `unlockedAmount()`, even if safe. This could cause problems for the protocol. The protocol may need to reduce vesting allocations due to several factors (tokenomics adjustment, user agreement etc) but they are forced to retain inflated totals for users who have partially claimed tokens wasting pool's resources and limits the protocol's ability to adapt to changing conditions.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The condition should be

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.claimedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis()
```
