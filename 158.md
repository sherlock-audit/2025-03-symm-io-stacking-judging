# Insufficient Pending Rewards Check in configureRewardToken

### Summary

Removing a reward token is allowed with pending rewards (≤10 wei), causing users to lose unclaimed rewards.

### Root Cause

The function checks pendingRewards[token] > 10 instead of > 0, allowing removal with residual rewards. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320)

### Internal Pre-conditions

Token is whitelisted.
pendingRewards[token] is non-zero but ≤10.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin calls configureRewardToken to remove the token.

### Attack Path

Admin removes a reward token with pendingRewards = 5.
Users’ earned rewards for the token become unclaimable as the token is no longer processed.

### Impact

Users lose access to small reward amounts.
Protocol integrity compromised due to stuck rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the check to pendingRewards[token] != 0:
