# Lack of `_disableInitializers` in SymmStaking Contract Poses Security Risk

### Title:
****

### Summary:
The Symmetric Staking Contract does not implement the `_disableInitializers` function in its constructor, as recommended by OpenZeppelin's documentation. This omission leaves the implementation contract uninitialized, creating a potential vulnerability where an attacker could take control of the proxy and alter the contract’s logic. To prevent such risks, it is crucial to lock the contract upon deployment by calling the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor.

### Root Cause:
- **Absence of `_disableInitializers`**: The Symmetric Staking contract constructor does not call the `_disableInitializers()` function, leaving the contract vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Uninitialized Implementation Contract**: If the implementation contract remains uninitialized, it could be used by an attacker to gain control over the proxy and modify the contract’s behavior. This occurs because the contract is still in an uninitialized state, which is a potential security loophole.

### Mitigation:
1. **Add `_disableInitializers` in Constructor**: To prevent the contract from being used after deployment, ensure that the `_disableInitializers()` function is called in the constructor of the Symmetric Staking contract.
   ```solidity
   constructor() {
       _disableInitializers();  // Ensures the contract cannot be re-initialized after deployment
   }
   ```

2. **Follow OpenZeppelin Guidelines**: Ensure all upgradeable contracts follow OpenZeppelin’s best practices for initialization and disabling re-initialization to prevent vulnerabilities related to proxy attacks.
