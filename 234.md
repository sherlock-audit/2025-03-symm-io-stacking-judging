# Malicious user can spam rewards distribution causing users to miss out on rewards

### Summary

per the [SYMIO](https://docs.symmio.foundation/token-related/tokenomics/staking-program#are-there-any-lockup-periods) vesting documentation:
> Symmio staking works without lockups, users can stake anytime to earn rewards for the period staked and unstake at any time **without loosing any rewards**...

Hence if a reward duration is 1000s user stakes for 1000s he earns all the rewards due for 1000s

### Root Cause

However, because the amount of reward that can be notified is not capped at a minimum and can be called by anyone the reward duration can be extended with dust amount causing the user to whose stakes for a particular distribution period to  miss to loose rewards because the rewards distribution rate is also recalculated and reduced 

```solidity
File: token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol
366: 	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
367: 		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
368: 
369: 		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
370: 			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
371: 		} else {
372: 			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
373: 			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
374: 	@>		state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
375: 		}
376: 
377: 		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
378: 	@>	state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
379: 	}

```

As seen from above, `_addRewardsForToken()`, the `state.rate` is recalculated and `state.periodFinish` is extended by the `state.duration`.
Hence a malicious user can call `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei of a reward token of interest, thus extending distirbution period of the current rewards amount and reducing the distribution causing the stakers to earn less in the reward period and forcing them to extend their stake against their wish.

Also worthy of note is that a malicious user can use this attack path to earn more rewards from a particular reward distribution period by pushing the `periodFinish` forward continuously.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- Alice and Bob are the current stakers with 50_000 tokens each and they both intend to stake for 1001 seconds
-  10_000 USDC was distributed in the current reward period spanning 1000 seconds (for simplicity)
- `state.rate = amount / state.duration` => 10_000 / 1000 = 10 USDC per second
- `state.periodFinish` = end of the next 1000 seconds
- 500 seconds into the period 5_000 USDC left to be distributed, Carol calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei of USDC and
    - `state.rate ` drops to `5_001 / 1000` = 5 USDC per second and will be distributed for the next 1000s seconds
    - Alice and Bob are either forced to extend their stake period by an extra 500 seconds or unstake at the 1000th second and loose the remaining rewards due them if Carol had not spammed the rewards ditribution

### Impact

Users will receive less rewards for a particular period and / or will be forced to stake beyond their intended staking period

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increase the minimum amount of rewards that can be added for each reward token.
