# Precision Loss in `_addRewardsForToken` Function Causes Unclaimable Reward Amounts

### Summary

In the `SymmStaking.sol` contract there is a precision loss in the `_addRewardsForToken` function when calculating `state.rate`, which results in some of the reward funds being locked in the contract and not being available for distribution. This leads to economic loss.

### Root Cause

In the `_addRewardsForToken` function the formular  `state.rate = amount / state.duration;` and `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;` in the calculation of the `state.rate` cause precision loss. since this function is passed to the `notifyRewardAmount` this causes the result of the final reward amount `state.rate * state.duration` being less than the `amount` actually passed to the `notifyRewardAmount` function. Since there is no suitable function to extract this remaining portion of funds, it causes economic loss


### Internal Pre-conditions

it always happens








### External Pre-conditions

it always happens the longer the stake duration the higher the loss

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

The precision loss in the `SymmStaking.sol` contract's `_addRewardsForToken` function results in a portion of the reward funds being locked in the contract and unavailable for distribution.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since there is already an admin who redistributes to withdraw rewards if there is no stakers.. consider also adding an admin function to extract the reward tokens that remain undistributed due to precision loss.
