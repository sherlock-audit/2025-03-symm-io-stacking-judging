# Removal of reward token in whitelist can be blocked

### Summary

Removing a reward token is susceptible to DDOS. There is no minimum staking amount and no minimum reward. An attacker can  stake a minuscule amount on a lot of addresses and/or deposit small amounts of rewards to block the removal process

### Root Cause

[Symmstaking.sol:320](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) there following condition is checked when removing a reward from the whitelist

```solidity
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]); 
```

A user can DDOS this functionality in two ways:

1. Stake a minuscule amount on a lot of addresses to accumulate a small reward such that the above check fails.
2. Use call `notifyRewardAmount` with a small amount to deposit dust amount to block the removal process.

### Internal Pre-conditions

For the DDOS based on staking there must still be rewards left to issue so that the attackers can accumulate a small amount of rewards in a bunch of addresses

For the DDOS based on calling `notifyRewardAmount` there is no pre-conditions. Anybody can add dust amount at any time. 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Two attack paths that can be combined or used separately:

First:
Stake a dust amount on multiple addresses to receive a small amount off reward to block the removal of the whitelist

Second:
Deposit small amounts of reward with the `notifiyRewardAmount()` to block the removal.


### Impact

The removal of reward token in the whitelist is blocked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add minimum amount to both the `deposit()` and `notifyRewardAmount()` function.
