# [M-06] Withdraw Function Updates State After Token Transfer

## Summary

The `withdraw` function in SymmStaking.sol violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern by performing token transfers before updating state variables, creating a potential reentrancy vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

In SymmStaking.sol:250-260, the `withdraw` function performs a token transfer before updating critical state variables:

Code reference: SymmStaking.sol#L250-L260 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L250-L260

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);  // External call before state updates
    totalSupply -= amount;                          // State update after external call
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;                // State update after external call
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```

The issue is that the function makes an external call to `safeTransfer` on line 255 before updating the contract's state variables (`totalSupply` and `balanceOf`) on lines 256-257. This violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which recommends updating state variables before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.

While the contract does use the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard, following the checks-effects-interactions pattern is still a best practice for several reasons:

1. Defense in depth: Multiple layers of protection against reentrancy are better than relying on a single mechanism.
2. Future-proofing: If the `nonReentrant` modifier is accidentally removed in a future update, the code would still be protected.
3. Cross-function reentrancy: The `nonReentrant` modifier only protects against direct reentrancy into the same function, not cross-function reentrancy.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the presence of the `nonReentrant` modifier, which prevents direct reentrancy. However, the violation of the checks-effects-interactions pattern could still lead to:

1. **Cross-Function Reentrancy**: If the token transfer triggers a callback that interacts with other functions in the contract, those functions might operate on stale state data.

2. **Potential Fund Loss**: In the worst case, if the `nonReentrant` modifier is removed or bypassed, an attacker could potentially withdraw more tokens than they should be able to.

3. **Inconsistent State**: If the token transfer fails after the state has been updated, the contract's state would be inconsistent with the actual token balances.

4. **Maintenance Risk**: The code pattern increases the risk of introducing vulnerabilities during future maintenance or upgrades.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// SymmStaking.sol:250-260
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);  // External call before state updates
    totalSupply -= amount;                          // State update after external call
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;                // State update after external call
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reorder the operations in the `withdraw` function to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
    
    // Update state variables first
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
    
    // Make external calls after state updates
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```

This change ensures that the contract's state is updated before any external calls are made, following the checks-effects-interactions pattern and providing an additional layer of protection against potential reentrancy attacks.
