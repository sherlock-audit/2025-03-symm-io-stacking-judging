# Users avoiding penalties via liquidity provision will cause reduced staking participation, diluting rewards for remaining stakers

### Summary

Root Cause: The protocol’s tokenomics create competing incentives between staking (via SymmStaking) and penalty avoidance via liquidity provision (via SymmVesting), reducing totalSupply in the staking contract.
Impact: Remaining stakers receive diluted rewards as the reward-per-token rate becomes volatile and dependent on fluctuating participation.

### Root Cause

Conflict:

Users can stake SYMM to earn rewards, but they can also lock SYMM in vesting to avoid penalties by adding liquidity to Balancer.

Problem: If users prioritize liquidity provision (to avoid penalties) over staking, the total staked SYMM in SymmStaking could drop, reducing the reward-per-token rate and diluting rewards for remaining stakers. This creates a conflict between the two mechanisms.

Code Evidence:

SymmStaking uses totalSupply to calculate rewardPerToken. A reduced totalSupply increases rewards per staker temporarily but depends on continuous staking.

SymmVesting’s addLiquidity reduces the user’s locked SYMM in vesting, but this SYMM is separate from staked SYMM. However, users may choose one over the other, creating unintended economic incentives.




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users need to have locked SYMM in vesting to set the stage for calling addLiquidity in SymmVesting.sol.

2. Users need to prioritize liquidity provision to avoid penalties, leading them to choose addLiquidity over staking their SYMM in SymmStaking.sol.

3. The total staked SYMM (totalSupply) in SymmStaking.sol needs to decrease as users withdraw SYMM from staking or avoid staking it in favor of liquidity provision.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Users with locked SYMM in vesting call addLiquidity in SymmVesting.sol to provide liquidity to Balancer, avoiding penalties.

2. These users either do not stake their SYMM in SymmStaking.sol or withdraw previously staked SYMM to use for liquidity provision.

3. The totalSupply of staked SYMM in SymmStaking.sol decreases as a result of reduced staking participation.

4. The rewardPerToken rate in SymmStaking.sol increases temporarily because rewards are now distributed among fewer staked tokens.

5. Remaining stakers see higher rewards per token, but overall staking participation declines, potentially weakening the staking mechanism over time.



### Impact

The stakers suffer an approximate dilution of rewards in the long term due to reduced staking participation. Although the rewardPerToken rate increases temporarily for remaining stakers, the broader impact includes:
- Reduced staking participation, which could compromise the security or decentralization of the system if staking plays a critical role.

- Imbalances in liquidity, as more SYMM is locked in liquidity provision rather than staking, potentially skewing the economic design of the protocol.

Users providing liquidity do not directly harm the system but inadvertently affect staking rewards through their economically motivated choices.

- Impact: Moderate. There is no immediate loss of funds, but the economic incentives could undermine the staking mechanism’s effectiveness over time.

- Likelihood: High. Users are likely to prioritize liquidity provision to avoid penalties, especially if penalties for early vesting unlocks are significant.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, the protocol could consider the following strategies:
1. Balance incentives: Adjust penalties or rewards to make staking as attractive as liquidity provision, ensuring users are not overly incentivized to choose one over the other.

2. Introduce dual rewards: Allow users to stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens or offer rewards for both staking and liquidity provision, aligning the two mechanisms.

3. Cap liquidity provision: Limit the amount of SYMM that can be locked for liquidity provision to maintain a minimum level of staking participation.

By aligning economic incentives, the protocol can prevent staking reward dilution and ensure a healthy balance between staking and liquidity provision.
