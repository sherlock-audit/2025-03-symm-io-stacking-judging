# reward token can't be removed

### Summary

in `notifyRewardAmount` function the amount to be rewarded is added first then the `_addRewardsForToken` is called ignoring if there were any precision loss happening in this process that later on when all rewards is distributed and no one left and admin needs to remove the reward token he can't that will later leads to OOG error halting the protocol

later in `configureRewardToken` the check to remove a reward token is very tight that there could be a reward token that has no rewards left to claim but still can't be removed.


### Root Cause

This has multiple root causes
1. storing amount directly ignoring if there is a precision loss `pendingRewards[token]`
2. the tight constrains to remove the reward token `>10` 
3. the loss of 10 wei could happen from multiple 1 wei precision loss when user claim the rewards in `earned` function.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward token was added 
2. all rewards has beed succefully claimed
3. there will be still dust values in `pendingRewards[token]` caused from mulitple 1 wei precision loss happened during claiming rewards in `earned` function
4. wrong assigning `pendingRewards[token]` directly ignoring if there is any precision loss


### Impact

the protocol may be forced to keep a reward token active indefinitely, disrupting administration and reward management a clear denial-of-service risk in token removal or any function depends on `rewardTokens` array such 
1. _updateRewardsStates
2. _claimRewardsFor
due to OOG error


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Another method should be used to remove `rewardtoken`
