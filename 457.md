# Rewards for the initial period can be lost for the SymmStaking contract

### Summary

The function `notifyReward` calculates the reward rate per second and also records the start of the reward period. This has an edge case where rewards are not counted for the initial period of time until there is at least one participant.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

### Root Cause

Lets consider for example, that the duration was set as `2592000` (1 month).

**At Timestamp = X,**
`notifyRewardAmount` was initially called with a rewards amount of  `2592000`. This implies that the reward rate is 1 token per second:

```solidity
state.rate = amount / state.duration;
```

So, the state at this point is:

`rate = 1`

`periodFinish = X + 2592000` 

**At** **Timestamp = X + Y,**

The first stake happens. The staker calls the `deposit` function, which calls the `_updateRewardsStates` function. The function updates a few state variables:

```solidity
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
```

Since, its the first stake:

```solidity
perTokenStored = 0
lastUpdated = X + Y
rewards[account][token] = 0
userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = 0
```

So, for the first staker, rewards will start accumulating from the timestamp → X + Y. They will start accumulating rewards after Y amount of time has been passed.

Please note, that the `periodFinish` is X + `rewardsDuration`, not X + Y + `rewardsDuration`. Therefore, the contract will only distribute rewards until X + `rewardsDuration`, losing Y * `rewardRate` => Y * 1 inside of the contract, as `rewardRate` = 1 (for this example).

If the delay (Y) was 30 min (1800 seconds), then:
`2592000-1800= 2590200` tokens will be distributed, and these 1800 tokens will remain unused in the contract.

The users do not receive the complete rewards intended for them in the given period. This is a loss for the users.

The protocol can choose to withdraw these unused tokens using rescue tokens function. But, even if the  protocol decides to start a new reward cycle to cover this unused amount, it is a redundant execution. As there will likely be a delay between the first stake and the next reward cycle initiation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The first deposit happens after notifyReward is called. 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Check the description in the root cause. It has an attack path mentioned.

### Impact

The users do not receive the complete rewards intended for them in the given period. This is a loss for the users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol can deposit some initial amount for itself, ensuring that there is some deposit at any given point in time.
