# Unsafe Typecasting in _addLiquidity Can Lead to Token Approval Failures

### Summary

In _addLiquidity, the contract uses uint160(symmIn) and uint160(usdcIn) when approving the PERMIT2 contract. If symmIn or usdcIn exceeds 2^160 - 1, the values will be truncated, leading to incorrect approvals. This could cause unexpected behavior, including failing transactions or approving an unintended amount of tokens.

### Root Cause

Since symmIn and usdcIn are uint256, casting them to uint160 truncates their values if they exceed 2^160 - 1 (~146 quintillion). This can lead to approvals for an unexpected amount, potentially disrupting liquidity operations.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The caller provides symmIn or usdcIn values larger than 2^160 - 1.
The function proceeds without validating that the values fit within uint160.

### External Pre-conditions

The contract must be interacting with an ERC-20 token that allows high values (e.g., rebasing tokens).
The transaction must include an amount exceeding 2^160 - 1.

### Attack Path

A user or attacker calls _addLiquidity with a large symmIn or usdcIn value.
The contract truncates the approval amounts when casting to uint160.
The PERMIT2.approve function approves an incorrect amount, potentially leading to:
A lower approval than intended, causing transaction failure.
An approval mismatch, leading to incorrect token spending limits.

### Impact

Liquidity Addition Can Fail: If symmIn or usdcIn is truncated, the contract may approve a lower amount than required, causing liquidity transactions to revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate the inputs before typecasting to uint160
