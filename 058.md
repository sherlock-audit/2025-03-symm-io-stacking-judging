# Incorrect `totalVested` Adjustment in  `_resetVestingPlans`

### Summary

In the `_resetVestingPlans` function, the `totalVested[token]` is updated by subtracting the `old locked amount` (instead of the old total vesting amount) and then adding the new total. This leads to an incorrect, often inflated, overall allocation for the token.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in The  `_resetVestingPlans`  function captures `oldTotal` as `vestingPlan.lockedAmount(`) rather than the vesting plan’s previous total allocation. When resetting, subtracting this partial value and adding the new total results in miscalculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A vesting plan with a defined total allocation exists.

The vesting plan has already unlocked a portion, so lockedAmount() is lower than the total.

### External Pre-conditions

Users have an existing vesting schedule that is being modified.

### Attack Path

The  `resetVestingPlans `   is called through   `resetVestingPlans`  function  with new amounts.

For each user, the function subtracts `vestingPlan.lockedAmount()` (e.g., the locked portion) instead of the entire previous allocation, then adds the new total.

### Impact

The protocol’s accounting becomes inconsistent. Future calculations that depend on totalVested may be wrong, potentially affecting vesting, claims, and overall token economics.

### PoC

. In _resetVestingPlans, when resetting the vesting plan, the code subtracts the old locked amount and adds the new amount (the new total). But the correct approach would be to subtract the old total and add the new total. Because the totalVested is the sum of all vesting plans' total amounts. For example:

When a vesting plan is set up with 1000, totalVested +=1000.

When resetting it to 600, totalVested should be 1000 -1000 +600 = 600.

But the code does:

oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount(); → which is 400 (original 1000 - 600 unlocked)

totalVested = totalVested - oldTotal + amount → totalVested -400 +600 → net +200. So the totalVested increases by 200, but it should decrease by 400 (from 1000 to 600). So this is a miscalculation.

The problem is that the code is using the old locked amount (400) instead of the old total (1000). So the totalVested is being adjusted incorrectly. Therefore, the line:

totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;

should instead be:

uint256 oldTotalAmount = vestingPlan.totalAmount(); // (function does not exists) which should be `lockedAmount + Unlocked amount`

totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotalAmount + amount;

But in the current code, the oldTotal is the lockedAmount(), which is part of the total. So subtracting the lockedAmount() and adding the new amount (which is the new total) is wrong. This leads to incorrect accounting of totalVested.

Therefore, in the _resetVestingPlans function, the code is subtracting the old locked amount and adding the new total, which is incorrect. It should subtract the old total and add the new total.

### Mitigation

Add Unlocked token amounts to the `uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();` which would be 

```solidity

uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount()  + vestingPlan.unlockedAmount();

```
