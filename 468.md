# Potential Liquidity Addition Failure Due to USDC Fee Deduction in `_addLiquidity` Function

### Summary:
In the `_addLiquidity` function, the contract assumes that the full `usdcIn` amount is transferred from the user. However, the USDC token used in the function has a fee on transfer, which means the user may transfer fewer tokens than expected. The contract then approves the original `usdcIn` amount to the `ROUTER` contract, which may lead to a mismatch between the actual token balance and the approved amount. This could result in the liquidity addition failing or reverting due to insufficient tokens, as the approved amount exceeds the actual available USDC.

### Root Cause:
- **USDC Transfer Fee**: The USDC token in this context has a fee on transfer, meaning that when a user sends `usdcIn` tokens, the contract may receive fewer tokens than expected.
- **Approval Mismatch**: The contract approves the original `usdcIn` amount to the `ROUTER` contract. However, due to the transfer fee, the actual balance of USDC the contract receives will be less than the approved amount. This results in a situation where the contract tries to add liquidity based on an overestimated USDC balance, causing the `addLiquidityProportional` function to potentially fail if the actual tokens are insufficient.

### Internal Pre-conditions:
- 

### External Pre-conditions:
- **USDC Token Implementation**: The USDC token contract must implement a fee on transfer, which reduces the actual amount of tokens transferred from the user's wallet to the contract.

### Impact:
- **Liquidity Addition Failure**: Due to the mismatch between the approved and actual token balances, the liquidity addition may fail or revert, causing the function to throw an error.
- **Increased Risk of Inaccurate Liquidity Calculation**: The function may overestimate the available USDC for liquidity provision, leading to unexpected behavior, such as the user not receiving the expected LP tokens or the contract failing to execute as intended.

### Attack Path:
function call will revert.

### Mitigation:
implement the amount of USDC transferred by balance before and balance after subtraction.
