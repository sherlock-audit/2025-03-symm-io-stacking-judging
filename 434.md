# Reward Vesting Time Can Be Extended Indefinitely by Small Deposits

### Summary

In the SymmStaking contract, the _addRewardsForToken function recalculates the reward release duration whenever new funds are added. An attacker can abuse this by repeatedly depositing minuscule amounts (e.g., 1 wei), causing rewards to be perpetually delayed, preventing users from claiming them as expected.

### Root Cause

In the [SymmStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378), whenever notifyRewardAmount is called, the contract extends the remaining duration for reward distribution, even for an insignificant deposit (e.g., 1 wei). This allows an attacker to intentionally delay all users’ reward claims indefinitely.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Initial Conditions
•	Assume rewardDuration = 7 days (default reward vesting period is one week).
•	Users expect to claim their rewards normally after 7 days.
•	At t = 3.5 days, rewards should be half unlocked.
2.	Attack Execution
•	At t = 3.5 days, attacker deposits 1 wei
Effect:
•	Contract extends the reward duration by another full cycle (7 days), instead of keeping the previous schedule.
•	Now, instead of being able to claim their rewards in 3.5 days, users must wait another full 7 days.
•	The attacker repeats this process every few days, ensuring rewards are never fully vested.
3.	Final Consequences
•	Users are unable to withdraw their staking rewards on time.
•	Stakers suffer from indefinite delays in expected earnings.
•	Attacker incurs almost no cost but disrupts the staking system entirely.

### Impact

•	Users cannot withdraw their rewards as expected.
•	Attacker can extend reward distribution indefinitely at minimal cost.
•	Staking APY (Annual Percentage Yield) decreases due to delayed payouts.
