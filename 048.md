# Insufficient Check for Pending Rewards in configureRewardToken can lead to loss of unclaimed rewards.

### Summary

The **configureRewardToken()** function contains a hardcoded check that only prevents token removal if pending rewards are greater than 10 wei. This threshold is problematic, especially for low-decimal tokens **(USDC with 6 decimals)**, where even small amounts can be significant.

### Root Cause

The **configureRewardToken()** function allows token removal if `pendingRewards ≤ 10`, causing users to lose unclaimed rewards when a token is removed from the whitelist.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The token must be actively whitelisted for rewards distribution.
2. Only REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE role should be allowed to configure reward tokens.
3. The Function Checks Pending Rewards:
-     The function verifies pendingRewards[token] > 10 before allowing removal.
-     The issue arises because 10 is an arbitrary threshold, and it does not consider token decimals.
4. If pendingRewards[token] ≤ 10, the function allows token removal, even if some rewards remain unclaimed.

### Mitigation

Use a token-decimals-aware threshold or disallow removal if `pendingRewards > 0`.

```solidity
if (pendingRewards[token] > 0) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
