# Missing Access Control in `notifyRewardAmount` Causes Complete Loss of Rewards for Stakers

### Summary

The missing access control modifier on `notifyRewardAmount` in `SymmStaking.sol` will cause a complete loss of rewards for stakers as any attacker can front-run legitimate reward distributions to drain the contract's reward tokens

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol`, the `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks the `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)` modifier, allowing any user to trigger it:
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused 
{
    // No access control
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one reward token (e.g., USDC, SYMM) must be whitelisted via `configureRewardToken` (executed by `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`)
2. The attacker has a minimal staked balance (to claim rewards later)

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by calling the notifyRewardAmount function with an inflated reward amount (e.g., 1,000,000 USDC) since there’s no access control in place. This updates the reward rate, falsely inflating the rewards for stakers. The attacker then stakes a small amount of SYMM tokens to qualify for rewards and immediately claims the rewards through the claimRewards() function, draining the contract’s reward pool. As a result, the attacker steals the entire reward balance, leaving legitimate stakers with nothing.



### Impact

- Stakers lose 100% of pending rewards for the manipulated token. For example, if the contract holds 1M USDC rewards, the attacker claims all of it.
-  Protocol’s reward distribution is disrupted, undermining trust in the staking mechanism.

### PoC

1. Assume:
   - USDC is whitelisted as a reward token.
   - Contract holds 1M USDC pending rewards.
2. Attack steps:
   - Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount(USDC, 1_000_000e18)`.
   - Attacker stakes 1 SYMM.
   - Attacker waits 1 block and calls `claimRewards()`, receiving all 1M USDC

### Mitigation

Add the `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)` modifier to `notifyRewardAmount`:
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) 
{

}
```
