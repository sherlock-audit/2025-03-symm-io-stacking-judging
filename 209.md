# In the `configureRewardToken` function when a token is unwhitelisted, the rewardState is not reset

### Summary

In the `configureRewardToken` function, when a token is unwhitelisted, it causes incorrect reward distributions for new stakers when the token is re-whitelisted. The problem arises from the fact that `rewardState[token]` is not reset when the token is removed or re-whitelisted.


### Root Cause


In [configureRewardToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312), when unwhitelisting a token (`status = false`), the contract removes the token from `rewardTokens` but leaves its `rewardState[token]`. As a result, `rewardState[token]` still retains the old values (`rate`, `periodFinish`, `perTokenStored`). Later, when `re-whitelisting` (`status = true`), the contract reuses stale `rewardState` values (e.g., `perTokenStored`, `rate`), leading to corruption in reward calculations for new staking periods.

```solidity
		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

re-whitelist reward token again 

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

- TokenA is whitelisted with `rate = 1000 tokens/week` and accumulates `perTokenStored = 1e18`.
- TokenA is removed but retains its `rewardState`.
- A new staker deposits tokens in `_updateRewardsStates` TokenA is not in the `rewardTokens` array not update state for new staker.
- TokenA is re-added `rewardState.duration` is reset, but `perTokenStored = 1e18` remains.
- Admin notifies `500 tokens`: The new `rate` is calculated as `500 / 1 week` (ignoring the old `perTokenStored`).
- For the new staker, Their rewards are calculated from `perTokenStored = 1e18 + new rewards`, even though they shouldn’t benefit from the prior period’s `perTokenStored`. This allows them to claim extra rewards not proportional to their stake duration.


### Impact


Re-whitelisting inherits outdated values (e.g., `perTokenStored` from prior cycles), which lead to incorrect reward distribution, potentially causing a loss of funds for the protocol or an unfair allocation of rewards to new stakers.

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
@>>			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```

_No response_

### Mitigation


Reset `rewardState` when unwhitelisting tokens. In `configureRewardToken()`:
```solidity
if (!status) {
    // ... existing checks ...
    delete rewardState[token]; // Reset all reward state variables
}
```
