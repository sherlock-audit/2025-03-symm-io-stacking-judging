# Loss of Precision in Reward Calculation Will Impact Token Rewards for Stakers

### Summary

The precision loss in reward calculations will cause incorrect reward distribution for stakers as small reward rates combined with large total supply values will result in truncation of rewards to zero.



### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:194-202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194C2-L202C3) the reward calculation performs multiplication before division which can cause significant precision loss when the rate is small relative to totalSupply:

```solidity
return
    rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
    (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
        totalSupply);
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `rewardState[token].rate` needs to be small (for example, less than totalSupply/1e18)
2. `totalSupply` needs to be large enough relative to the reward rate
3. Time elapsed since last update (difference between `lastTimeRewardApplicable()` and `lastUpdated`) needs to be non-zero


### External Pre-conditions

None applicable.

### Attack Path

1. **Protocol admin** calls `notifyRewardAmount()` to add a small amount of rewards for distribution over the standard week-long period
2. **The system** calculates a very small reward rate by dividing the reward amount by the duration (in seconds)
3. **Users** stake tokens, increasing the `totalSupply` to a large value
4. When **the system** calculates `rewardPerToken()`, the multiplication `(time_elapsed * rate * 1e18)` produces a value less than `totalSupply`, causing integer division to truncate to zero
5. As a result, `perTokenStored` doesn't increase and users receive no rewards even though rewards have technically accrued


### Impact

The stakers suffer an approximate loss of 100% of their expected rewards for periods when the calculation truncates to zero. The protocol retains these rewards that should have been distributed, creating an accounting discrepancy between the actual rewards paid and the recorded pending rewards.

## Real-world Scenario with Small Rate

In real deployments, the situation would be worse with:

1. Large total supply (millions of tokens staked)
2. Small reward rates (fractions of tokens per second)

For example:
- Reward amount = 1000 tokens
- Duration = 1 week (604,800 seconds)
- Rate = 0.00165 tokens per second
- Total supply = 1,000,000 tokens

The calculation would be:
```solidity
rewardPerToken = (timeElapsed * rate * 1e18) / totalSupply
rewardPerToken = (200 * 0.00165 * 1e18) / 1,000,000
rewardPerToken = 330,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 330
```

This small value would then be used to calculate each user's reward:
```solidity
userReward = userBalance * rewardPerToken / 1e18
```

With a balance of 10 tokens:
```solidity
userReward = 10 * 330 / 1e18 = 0.00000000000000033
```

This would truncate to 0 due to integer division!

## Conclusion

While the test cases were designed with conveniently chosen values that avoid precision issues, they still reveal evidence of integer truncation. In a real-world environment with a larger total supply or smaller reward rate, users would consistently lose rewards due to the calculation method, potentially receiving zero rewards when they should receive small amounts.

### Mitigation

Change the order of operations in the `rewardPerToken()` function to prevent precision loss:

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    }
    
    // Rearrange calculation to perform division after multiplication with the large scaling factor
    return
        rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
        ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18 / totalSupply);
}
```

Alternative approach with higher precision:

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    }
    
    uint256 timeElapsed = lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated;
    
    // First multiply by 1e18, then by rate, then divide by totalSupply
    uint256 rewardPerTokenDelta = (timeElapsed * 1e18 / totalSupply) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate;
    
    return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored + rewardPerTokenDelta;
}
```

This ensures that even with very small reward rates, users will still receive proportional rewards without truncation to zero.
