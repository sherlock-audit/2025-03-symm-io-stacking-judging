# removing token from reward tokens can be DOSed

### Summary

In `configureRewardToken`, we see a check where they check if `pendingRewards` for token to remove is more than 10

This require statement can be used to permanently DOS it as the amount can be deposited in small amounts such that even rate is zero. 

The amount is deposited using the `notifyRewardAmount` function

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320

we see the require statement checks pending rewards, and only allows if its lesser than 10

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.

### External Pre-conditions

1.

### Attack Path

1. Very small amount can be notified such that rate becomes zero
2. pending rewards is always the small amount setting `state.rate` to zero
3. no rewards can be claimed and pending rewards will never be zero


### Impact

Protocol owner cannot remove a reward token

### PoC
