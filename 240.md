# Potential misuse of `notifyRewardAmount` by unauthorized parties

### Summary

The function `notifyRewardAmount` in the staking contract is publicly callable without access restrictions. This allows any user to supply reward tokens and trigger a new reward epoch, which could be abused to spam the reward system or manipulate the reward schedule.

### Root Cause

In [SymStaking:275](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275), the `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks an access control modifier, allowing anyone to call it​. This function is intended to add reward tokens for distribution, and while a caller must supply the tokens, the lack of restriction could lead to unpredictable reward scheduling or griefing. An attacker cannot steal funds through this (since they must provide tokens), but they could manipulate the rewards schedule in undesirable ways. For example, a rogue user might continuously notify tiny reward amounts to spam events and create many short reward periods, potentially confusing legitimate staking rewards accounting. If the staking token or reward token has any fee or callback on transfer, an attacker could also use `notifyRewardAmount` to trigger those repeatedly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract’s reward distribution logic is triggered solely by calls to `notifyRewardAmount`.
2. The internal state updates assume legitimate reward amounts.

### External Pre-conditions

1. External tokens provided must be whitelisted; however, any approved token can be used.
2. No external checks prevent repetitive small-value reward notifications.

### Attack Path

A malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount` repeatedly with a whitelisted reward token (e.g., SYMM or a stablecoin) and very small amounts. This causes the contract to accept the tokens and start new reward epochs for each call. Stakers might find that rewards are arriving in many micro-intervals, increasing gas costs for claiming and cluttering the system with events. In a more contrived scenario, if a reward token had a malicious transfer hook, the attacker could use this open function to execute that hook via the staking contract. While the attacker loses the tokens they send as rewards, they could aim to disrupt the reward mechanism or execute denial-of-service by overwhelming the contract with state updates.

### Impact

Stakers suffer increased gas costs and potential misallocation of rewards; the attacker might not gain directly but disrupts system operation.

### Mitigation

If open reward funding is not a requirement, restrict `notifyRewardAmount` to an authorized role (e.g., a `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`) so only trusted accounts can schedule rewards. If the intention is to allow anyone to contribute rewards, implement rate-limits or minimum amounts to prevent spamming, and carefully vet whitelisted reward tokens. Document clearly that `notifyRewardAmount` is permissionless so the community is aware that arbitrary rewards can be added by anyone. In all cases, ensure that whitelisted reward tokens are audited and do not have harmful transfer behavior.
