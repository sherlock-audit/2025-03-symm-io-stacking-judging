# User are unable to add Liquidity when their LP SYMM vesting position has unlocked more than amount of liquidity to add.

### Summary

Docs state that one of the key features of symm vesting contracts is the possibility for users to transfer their vested SYMM tokens to pool on balancer and in return get LP tokens received from the action vested. However due to the check inside reset vesting plans it is not always true, as there is check inside `_resetVestingPlans` that checks if currently unlocked amount of the vault is greater than new locked amount of vault.

### Root Cause

Inside `Vesting::_resetVestingPlans` that is called inside `_addLiquidityProcess` in SymmVesting, there is a check that reverts transaction if old vest unlockedAmount > new amount to be vested. This leads to the scenario in which users cannot add liquidity(change their vested SYMM token to LP tokens) when their unlocked amount is greater than LP vest lockedAmount + new amount. This can happen quite often if user has LP token vault that is closer to finish. In the documentation there is **NO** mention of any restrictions regarding adding liquidity function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has SYMM vest position


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has a SYMM vesting position where for example there is 800 locked SYMM
2. User call addLiquidity and setting amount to 400 SYMM
3. The liquidity received from the addLiquidity is for example 400
4.  Some time passes by and now in both vaults 3/4 of tokens is unlocked e.g 300
5. User tries to addLiquidity for 100 SYMM tokens
6. Liquidity received from that action would be e.g 100 LP tokens
7. The transaction fails due to the fact that LP vest::unlockedAmount= 300 which is greater than lockedAmount = 100 + newAmount (100)
8. User is unable to add Liquidity

### Impact

Users in some scenarios are unable to use one of the key functions inside the protocol, losing the ability to change their SYMM tokens to LP tokens on which they could earn yield by providing liquidity.

### PoC

Add new file called myBehaviour.ts and paste the code below. Call the function `shouldBehaveMyBehaviour` inside main.ts and run tests. 
This test shows simple example of DOS inside addLiquidity function.

### Mitigation

Remove the unnecessary check inside resetVestingPlan
