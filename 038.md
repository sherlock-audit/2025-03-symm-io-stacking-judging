# [M-09] Unvalidated Token Order Assumption in Pool Interaction

## Summary
The contract assumes a specific token order in Balancer Pool interactions without validation, creating vulnerability to token order changes.

## Vulnerability Detail
SymmVesting.sol:179-181 makes assumptions about token order in Balancer Pool that could be incorrect.
Code reference: [SymmVesting.sol#L179-L181](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L179-L181)

## Impact
If the token order in the pool changes, the contract will interact with the wrong tokens, potentially leading to failed transactions or fund loss.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
IERC20[] memory poolTokens = POOL.getTokens();
(IERC20 symm, IERC20 usdc) = (poolTokens[0], poolTokens[1]);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement validation to ensure the expected tokens are actually at the assumed indices, or use a more robust method to identify tokens regardless of their position in the array.
