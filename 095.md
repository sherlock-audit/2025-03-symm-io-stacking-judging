# Bypass of Penalties for Claiming Locked Vested Symm Tokens via Rounding Errors

## Root Cause

There is no check to ensure that the calculated penalty is not zero:

```javascript
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
```

## Recommended Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that the calculated penalty is greater than zero:

```diff
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
+   require(penalty > 0);
```

## Summary

Admins [set up vesting plans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L133) for users who intended to participate in the TGE and purchased Symm tokens.

As time passes, a portion of the vested tokens unlocks, allowing users to claim them without incurring any penalties.

However, users also have the option to withdraw the entire vested amount immediately, if they agree to incur a 50% penalty.

This penalty acts as a fee, which is sent to the designated receiver and redistributed among those who wait for their tokens to unlock naturally.

a user can exploit Solidityâ€™s rounding-down behavior. By withdrawing a very small amount of locked tokens (for example, 1 unit of Symm Tokens), the [penalty](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290) calculation:

```javascript
    penalty = (1 * 5e17) / 1e18 = 0.5 // zero
```

rounds down to zero, effectively bypassing the penalty. Additionally, the Symm Tokens do not revert on [zero value transfers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L296) which makes this attack feasible.

## Impact

An attacker can avoid paying the intended penalty when withdrawing locked vested tokens.
