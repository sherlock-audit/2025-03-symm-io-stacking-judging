# Precision loss when calculating the state.rate

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370

In the function `_addRewardsForToken` there is a precision loss. Exactly in this line:
```solidity
state.rate = amount / state.duration;
```
Let's say the amount = 10e6 and the state.duration = 604800 
Now we substitute into the formula: 10e6 / 604800 = 16.534 - but since solidity does truncation this gets rounded down to 16. Leading to precision loss by 3.23%.

The same issue is in this line:
```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

### Root Cause

The mistake is that there is an integer division. You should scale the numbers to prevent that.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

The state.rate will be non-precise and this could lead to under-distribution of rewards, because the rate that the rewards will be distributed is slightly lower than it should be. This results in 3.23% less rewards being distributed than intended. 

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Scale the numbers by 1e18 to prevent integer division.
