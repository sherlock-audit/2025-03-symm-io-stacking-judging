# Griefer can frontrun and stop `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken` when a token is removed from `SymmStaking::rewardTokens` because the `notifyRewardAmount` function has no control access

### Summary

The missing control access in SymmStaking::configureRewardtoken allows any user to add liquidity and reward the protocol, however this generates some issues with the `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` function, where it asserts that there are less than 10 tokens in pendingRewards, and otherwise reverts. A griefer could simply frontrun the execution of cofigureRewardToken (when a token wants to be removed) by calling rewardTokens, and adding that minimal liquidity.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol:275 there is no control of who can call this function, creating this issue.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

This is the notifyRewardAmount, which has no control of who can call it, and just restarts the staking period again.

```javascript
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
And adds tokens to the protocol for that token.

Here is the `configureRewardToken` function:
```javascript
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

the following conditional revert is what could be exploited by simply adding the minimum liquidity.
```javascript
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one token has to be added
2. pendingRewards for that token has to be less than 10 (otherwise it would revert regardless of the external actor)

### External Pre-conditions

There are no significant external pre-conditions, other than the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE paying less than max tx fees.


### Attack Path

1. `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` adds a token
2. All rewards are claimed by users
3. the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` wants to remove the token, and calls `configureRewardToken` with the `token` address, and `status`: false as arguments.
4. Griefer sees the call to `configureRewardToken` in the tx pool
5. He calls `notifyRewardAmount` paying more fees to front-run it.
6. The `configureRewardToken` call reverts, given that there are 10 tokens to be rewarded

### Impact

Currently, the only solution would be pausing the protocol before executing the `configureRewardToken` call. But given that the `notifyRewardAmount` restarts the period when rewards are added AND can be executed at any moment, the user could keep adding tokens without being close to the end of the period, and making that fix stop the protocol for half a reward period, or more.
If the protocol has any reason to want to remove a token from the protocol (other than having less than 10 tokens to award) it might become impossible to do it. Especially so with stablecoins or low-priced `ERC-20`. Users then might stake for that token receiving an extremely minimal payout, or interfaces become clustered.
Issues arising with one or more of the allowed tokens could also create further risks.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding access control to `notifyRewardAmount` is suggested.
