# [M-03] Paused State Bypass for `rescueTokens` allows admins to withdraw user tokens while contract is expected to be paused.

### Summary

The function `rescueTokens` in `SymmStaking.sol` does not enforce the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing **admins to withdraw tokens from specific users** even when the contract is paused. This bypasses the expected security and control measures of the pause mechanism.


### Root Cause

- `rescueTokens` does not have `whenNotPaused`:  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **The contract's `paused` variable must be `true`**, indicating that interactions should be disabled.
2. **The function `rescueTokens` must lack the `whenNotPaused` modifier**, allowing execution despite the contract being paused.
3. **The targeted user must have a token balance that can be withdrawn**.
4. **Admin must call `rescueTokens`** to withdraw `{amount}` of `{token}` from `{user}` while the contract is paused.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **The contract must have been paused** by an admin or governance action.
2. **Users must have a token balance that can be withdrawn**.
3. **The protocol must rely on pausing as a security control**, assuming that movement of assets is disabled while paused.


### Attack Path

1. **Admin** calls `rescueTokens(token, amount, receiver)` while the contract is paused.
2. **The function executes despite the paused state**, withdrawing tokens from a specific user's balance.
3. **User funds are moved while the protocol is assumed to be in a frozen state**.
4. **The pause mechanism fails to prevent token withdrawals**, weakening protocol security.


### Impact

- **Admins can withdraw user funds while the contract is paused**, even if the pause was meant to freeze all asset movement.
- **Users may have their tokens moved when they expect them to be locked**, creating trust and security concerns.
- **The pause mechanism loses effectiveness**, as token withdrawals remain possible.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To align with the expected behavior of the `paused` state, add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the function:

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) 
    external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) whenNotPaused 
{ 
    // Function logic
}
```
