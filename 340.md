# Admins Are Forced to Set an Unnecessarily High Vesting Amount When Resetting a Vesting Plan

### Summary

In _resetVestingPlans(), if a user has a large unlocked amount, the admin must reset the vesting plan with an amount at least as big as the unlocked amount. This forces the admin to:

Use an artificially high vesting amount, even if they only want to set a lower amount.

### Root Cause

amount Must Be Greater Than unlockedAmount()

- The function currently does not allow resetting to a lower total amount.
- The check forces amount to be at least unlockedAmount(), even though unlocked tokens are already claimable and shouldnâ€™t be part of the new vesting plan.

Unnecessary Constraints on Vesting Resets

- In many real-world cases, an admin might want to reset the vesting schedule to a lower total amount.
- This is currently not possible if the unlocked amount is large.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A user must already have a vesting plan.
- The function must be called by an admin with SETTER_ROLE.
- The user must have a high unlockedAmount().

### External Pre-conditions

- The admin attempts to reset a vesting plan but is forced to use a larger amount than intended.
- If the admin tries to use a smaller amount, the transaction will revert.

### Attack Path

- User has a vesting plan for 100 tokens.
- Over time, 90 tokens have unlocked (high unlockedAmount).
- Admin wants to reset vesting to only 20 new locked tokens.
- Admin calls _resetVestingPlans(token, [user], [20]).
- The transaction reverts because 20 < unlockedAmount (90).
- Admin is forced to use amount = 90+X instead, even if they only wanted 20 new locked tokens.
- This results in inefficient vesting allocation.

### Impact

- Inflexible Vesting Plan Resets: Admins cannot reset vesting to a lower amount if a large portion is already unlocked.
- Wasted Tokens: Admins must allocate more tokens than necessary, leading to inefficient distribution.

### Mitigation

Remove the Restriction in _resetVestingPlans()

`if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis(); // remove this line`
