# Uninitialized storage variables

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366

In the function `_addRewardsForToken` there are uninitialized storage variables when executing for the first time.
`state.rate`, `state.duration`, `state.lastUpdated` and `state.periodFinish`.

Uninitialized variables default to 0. Meaning the function will update the state incorrectly. For example here:
```solidity
	uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
	uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
	state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;																								
```
You first set the remaining. Then leftover, but because state.rate is not initialized it defaults to 0. 
Meaning leftover = 0. And after that you set the state.rate.
But because leftover is 0 you are using only state.rate = amount / state.duration.

### Root Cause

Incorrectly initialized storage variables.

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

The function incorrectly updates the state of the contract. Also you are dividing with state.duration which is uninitialized and defaults to 0, which would cause the transaction to revert.

Making the function completely unusable

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Set the storage variables in the `initialize` function or ensure correct initialization.
