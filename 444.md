# Any Users Can Manipulate Reward Distribution in SymmStaking to wipe out rewards

### Summary

A missing access control check in the notifyRewardAmount function allows any user to add rewards to the staking contract, which can manipulate the reward rate calculation and lead to incorrect reward distributions for stakers.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol`, the `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks proper access control checks. While the `configureRewardToken` function correctly restricts access to users with the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`, the `notifyRewardAmount` function does not have the same restriction, allowing any user to call it and add rewards as long as the token is already configured.

The main issue being that when `_addRewardsForToken` is called from `notifyRewardAmount` the reward state rate is set to Zero due to `(amount + leftover) / state.duration` rounding down to zero when amount is very small.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `configureRewardToken` to set a token (e.g., USDT) as an approved reward token
2. At least one user needs to have staked tokens in the contract
3. Admin needs to have called `notifyRewardAmount` at least once to set up the initial reward distribution

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker needs to have a small amount of the configured reward token (even 1 wei is sufficient)

### Attack Path

1. Admin configures USDT as a reward token and notifies a large reward amount (e.g., 604,800 tokens) to be distributed over a period (e.g., 7 days)
2. The contract calculates the reward rate as rewardAmount / duration (604,800 / 604,800 = 1 token per second)
3. After some time passes, an attacker approves a small amount (e.g., 1 token) of USDT to the staking contract
4. The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount with this small amount
5. The contract recalculates the reward rate by adding the remaining rewards to the new amount and dividing by the duration and this can round down to Zero.
6. This manipulation can significantly alter the reward rate, especially if done near the beginning of a reward period
7. When users claim rewards, they receive incorrect amounts based on the manipulated rate

### Impact

The staking protocol suffers from incorrect reward distributions. Depending on when the attack is executed, users may receive fewer rewards than intended. This can lead to:

1.  Loss of rewards for legitimate stakers
2.  Potential drain of excess rewards to attackers
3.  Undermining the tokenomics and incentive structure of the protocol
4.  The severity is high as it directly impacts the economic model of the staking system and can lead to financial losses for the protocol and its users.

### PoC

```Typescript
import { SignerWithAddress } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers"
import { loadFixture, time } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers"
import { expect } from "chai"
import { ethers } from "hardhat"
import { ERC20, Symmio, SymmStaking } from "../typechain-types"
import { e } from "../utils"
import { initializeFixture, RunContext } from "./Initialize.fixture"

export function shouldBehaveLikePocs() {
	let context: RunContext
	let symmStaking: SymmStaking
	let stakingToken: Symmio
	let user1: SignerWithAddress
	let user2: SignerWithAddress
	let admin: SignerWithAddress
	let usdtToken: ERC20
	let usdcToken: ERC20

	beforeEach(async function () {
		context = await loadFixture(initializeFixture)
		symmStaking = context.symmStaking
		admin = context.signers.admin
		user1 = context.signers.user1
		user2 = context.signers.user2
		stakingToken = context.symmioToken

		await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user1.address, initialBalance)
		await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user2.address, initialBalance)
		await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(admin.address, initialBalance)

		// 2. Deploy USDT (ERC20) and USDC (ERC20) tokens
		const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20")

		// USDT Token
		usdtToken = await ERC20.connect(admin).deploy("USDT", "USDT")
		await usdtToken.waitForDeployment()

		// USDC Token
		usdcToken = await ERC20.deploy("USDC", "USDC")
		await usdcToken.waitForDeployment()
	})

	describe.only("POCs", function () {
		it.only("should reward users correctly POC", async function () {
			// Give user2 some USDT
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2.address, 1)

			const depositAmount = "604800" // user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM

### How to run the POC
Create a new file pocs.behaviour.ts in the test directory and copy the above POC into that file.  In tests/main.ts import the file `import { shouldBehaveLikePocs } from "./pocs.behaviour"` and add the following code snippet to the `Static Test::Symm token` scenario.

```Typescript
describe("POCs", async function () {
	shouldBehaveLikePocs()
})
```

### Mitigation

1.

Add proper access control to the `notifyRewardAmount` function by requiring the caller to have the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`:

```Solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant {
    require(tokens.length == amounts.length, "SymmStaking: tokens and amounts length mismatch");
    
    // Add this line to enforce access control
    require(hasRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, _msgSender()), "SymmStaking: must have reward manager role to notify reward");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        
        require(rewardTokens.contains(token), "SymmStaking: token not configured");
        
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
        
        emit RewardAdded(token, amount);
        
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

2.  ensure `(amount + leftover) > state.duartion`
