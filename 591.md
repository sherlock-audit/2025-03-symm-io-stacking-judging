# Rescue tokens function does not update the reward rate, resulting in users earning incorrect amount of tokens.

### Summary

Rescue tokens function does not update the reward rate, resulting in users earning an incorrect amount of tokens.

### Root Cause

Whenever `rescueToken` is called for any reason by the ADMIN:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L337-L346

It removes the `amount` of a given token. The problem is if a reward token is being removed, the reward rate is not being updated to reflect the same. So, if reward tokens are removed, as it is not accurately being reflected in the reward rate, the users will be earning more tokens than the balance of the contract.

This leads to users not being able to claim their complete rewards, as it will revert because of low token balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin calls rescue tokens function and removes some `amount` of reward tokens from the contract 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The earning of the users will be more than the balance of the reward token in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the reward rate in the contract when the reward tokens are being rescued in the `rescueTokens` function
