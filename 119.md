# Malicious actors can dilute the staking rewards to a longer timeframe

### Summary

Symmio allows any user to add incentives in the form of whitelisted tokens to vaults on symmio staking contract. However, adding incentives while other incentives are already live dilutes the total reward over a longer timeframe, which can be exploited by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

any user can add incentives 
adding new incentives increment total time frame for all previous incentives 

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

1. protocol notifies 1000e6 usdc for rewards 
2. at 3.5 days bob deposits 1 wei of usdc causing the remaining 500e6 usdc to be spread over 7 days 
3. bob does this again at 3.5 days causing the remaining 250e6 usdc to be spread over another 7 days, at this point bob has doubled the initial duration it would have taken to receive the rewards 
4. bob continues to do this over and over again 

### Impact

Time to gain the intended reward can be arbitrarily increased by malicious users.

### PoC

none 

### Mitigation

Consider adding new rewards to a buffer of rewards, which would not influence the current reward period. Once the current reward period is finished, a new one can start with new rewards allocated from the reward buffer.
