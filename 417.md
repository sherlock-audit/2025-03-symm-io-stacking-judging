# users reward tokens can be withdrawed  via rescueTokens also Admin Can Drain User Funds via rescueTokens

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343

**Description**: The `rescueTokens` function in `SymmStaking.sol` allows an admin to withdraw any token from the contract, including the staking token itself and active reward tokens.

 it doesn't check anything when if stakers are 0 . So some parts(or 100%) of rewards can be withdrawn before the staking period. In this case, the reward system won't work properly due to the lack of rewards.

Also if admin is compromised if can lead to total withdraw of all funds wrongly


### Root Cause


**there are two possible scenario here**

**Root Cause**: There's no check to prevent the admin from taking user stake deposits or reward tokens, creating a significant  risk.

Also , if admin address is compromise for any reason it can lead to total drain of all users funds 

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are two way to this

* admin needs to call rescureTokens then this will withdraw tokens including staking tokens or rewards

* then the next part is if admin is compromise , then it will be a total wreck of users funds 

### External Pre-conditions

* users need to stake 
* funds have to be in the tokens 

### Attack Path

* Admin calls rescueTokens  putting in parameter the token he needed to withdraw 
* This will withdraw all tokens one by one till he finally withdraw every token 


### Impact

The reward system would be broken as the rewards can be withdrawn 

 A malicious or compromised admin could drain the contract of all tokens, including user deposits and rewards.

### PoC

* users stake in symmStaking
* users earn some reward in the staking
* admin calls rescueToken  withdrawing both users reward and tokens 

if admin address  gets compromised it can always lead to complete drain of the protocol

### Mitigation

**Recommendation**: Add checks to prevent withdrawing staking tokens and active reward tokens:

//  this metigation below is a simple one so i advice for it to be modified to something more reasonable 
```solidity

function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (token == stakingToken) revert CannotRescueStakingToken();
    if (isRewardToken[token]) revert CannotRescueRewardToken();
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```
This metigation above can be modified maybe to check if there are stakers already in the protocol to avoid withdrawing users reward

for example this is a metigation according to a similar issue in mute.io protocol

```solidity
else if (tokenToRescue == muteToken) {
    if (totalStakers > 0) { //should check totalReclaimed as well
        require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards.sub(totalClaimedRewards).sub(totalReclaimed)),
            "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"
        );
    }
    else if(block.timestamp <= endTime) { //no stakers but staking is still active, should maintain totalRewards
        require(amount <= IERC20(muteToken).balanceOf(address(this)).sub(totalRewards),
            "MuteAmplifier::rescueTokens: that muteToken belongs to stakers"
        );
    }
}
```

for the second phase is important to use a multisig wallet as admin role in other not to depends on a single address
