# Rewards can be pushed forward by dusting notifyRewardAmount

### Summary

Anybody can push the duration of a reward forward in time by sending a dust amount to `notifyRewardAmount()`

### Root Cause

in [SymmStaking.sol:275](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) the `notifyRewardAmount()` has no access control or minimum amount off a reward that can be added.

```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused { //n add new rewards for token 

		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token); 

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); 
			pendingRewards[token] += amount; 
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}

```

When a dust amount if added the duration of the staking distribution is pushed forward

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) { 
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}


```

By doing this an attacker is essentially changing the reward duration without adding any rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

An active reward has to be available.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Simply  call `notifiyrewardsAmount()` with a dust amount

### Impact

The maximum impact is reached if the `notifyRewardsAmount()` function is dusted each block resulting in the total vested reward being pushed out indefinitely 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a minimum amount of reward that can be added and/or access control such that only admin can add rewards.
