# Faulty Reward Calculation will cause accumulated reward loss for stakers

### Summary

Precision loss due to integer division in the reward calculation will cause gradual loss of reward amounts for stakers as the staking contract’s reward update functions will continuously lose fractional values during each reward notification and accrual.


### Root Cause

- In `token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol`, in the `_addRewardsForToken` function the rate calculation uses integer division without adjusting for the residual amount. This causes a loss in precision on every reward notification.
- In addition, the accumulation of these tiny losses is reflected in the `pendingRewards` and the `earned` computation, potentially causing disproportionate reward distribution and even denial of removing a reward token when residuals build-up (if `pendingRewards > 10`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Someone call `notifyRewardAmount()` to set new reward amounts, which in turn causes `_addRewardsForToken()` to recalculate the reward rate.
2. Any user needs to stake tokens via `deposit()` so that their rewards are computed using the imprecise rate.
3. The contract repeatedly updates its reward state (via `_updateRewardsStates()`) without accommodating for the leftover residual from integer division.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Continuity in reward notifications and user deposits/withdrawals creates a scenario where residuals are repeatedly lost over successive periods.


### Attack Path

1. A user calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with a new reward amount.
amount = 907099999 USDC

incase current duration is in progress
for simplicity assume
remaining = 1
leftover = 1 * 100000;

rate = (amount + leftover) / duration // duration is set to 1 week
rate = (907099999+100000)/(60\*60\*24\*7)
rate = 1499
rate * duration = 1499 * (60\*60\*24\*7) = 906595200

allAmount - (rate * duration) = 907199999 - 906595200 = 604799 USDC loss at a time

### Impact

- The stakers suffer an approximate loss in their deserved reward amounts due to the accumulating rounding errors in reward calculations. Over time, the imprecise calculations could lead to significant misallocation of rewards, effectively reducing user payouts. In the worst-case scenario, the protocol might no longer be able to remove a reward token or claim rewards correctly, halting normal operations.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


The mitigation is to not ignore the lost value by adjusting the function as follows:
```solidity
        amount = amount + state.Residual;
        state.Residual = amount % state.Duration;
        amount = amount - state.Residual;

        if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
            state.rate = amount / state.duration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;

            // Calculate total amount and its residual
            uint256 totalAmount = amount + leftover + state.Residual;
            state.Residual = totalAmount % state.duration;

            // Remove residual before setting rate
            totalAmount = totalAmount - state.Residual;
            state.rate = totalAmount / state.duration;
        }
```
