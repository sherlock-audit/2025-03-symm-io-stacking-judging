# Incorrect USDC Calculation in Liquidity Addition Risks User Losses

### Summary


Summary
The incorrect scaling and pool formula assumption in getLiquidityQuote will cause financial losses for liquidity providers as users will provide mismatched USDC amounts due to misaligned decimal adjustments and potentially incorrect pool logic.



### Root Cause

Root Cause
In SymmVesting.sol:245-248, the getLiquidityQuote function calculates the USDC amount as (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance using a constant product formula (e.g., Uniswap V2), which may not match the 80/20 weighted pool (e.g., Balancer), and applies an incorrect scaling of _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30) instead of the correct 1e12 for the decimal difference between SYMM (18 decimals) and USDC (6 decimals).


### Internal Pre-conditions


Internal Pre-conditions
Users need to call addLiquidity or addLiquidityByPercentage to set symmAmount to be at least 1 SYMM token to trigger liquidity addition.
The POOL contract needs to be initialized with non-zero symmBalance and usdcBalance to allow getLiquidityQuote to execute without reverting.
The SYMM and USDC token addresses need to be set correctly during initialize to reference tokens with 18 and 6 decimals, respectively.


### External Pre-conditions

The SYMM/USDC pool (via POOL) needs to maintain a balance ratio reflecting an 80/20 weighting (e.g., symmBalance 80% and usdcBalance 20% of total value) to expose the formula mismatch.
The ROUTER contract needs to enforce liquidity addition based on the pool’s actual formula, differing from the assumed constant product model.

### Attack Path


User calls addLiquidity(1000e18, 0, 0) to add 1000 SYMM to the SYMM/USDC pool, expecting to provide proportional USDC.
The getLiquidityQuote function calculates usdcAmount = (1000e18 * usdcBalance) / symmBalance, assuming a Uniswap V2-like constant product formula.
It then scales this with _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30), incorrectly adjusting for a 10^30 difference instead of the actual 10^12 (SYMM 18 decimals vs. USDC 6 decimals), resulting in a grossly inflated or misaligned usdcAmount.
The contract pulls the incorrect usdcAmount from the user via usdc.safeTransferFrom, which either fails (if insufficient) or over/under-supplies USDC compared to the pool’s 80/20 weighted requirements.
The ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional call either reverts due to mismatched amounts or completes with suboptimal LP token issuance, causing the user to lose funds or receive fewer LP tokens than expected.

### Impact


The liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss of up to 100% of their expected LP tokens or excess USDC due to transaction failures or misaligned liquidity provision. The protocol does not gain directly, but users experience financial loss or operational disruption.

        console.log("Calculated USDC amount:", usdcAmount / 1e6, "USDC");
        console.log("Expected LP amount:", lpAmount);

        // Expected USDC for 80/20 pool: (1000 * 2000e6) / 8000e18 = 250e6 USDC

        assertApproxEqAbs(usdcAmount, expectedUsdc, 1e6, "Incorrect USDC calculation");
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To address the incorrect USDC calculation issue, implement the following mitigation steps:
Verify Pool Formula:
Update getLiquidityQuote to reflect the correct pool formula (e.g., Balancer’s weighted pool). For an 80/20 pool:

```solidity
function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
    uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
    uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
    uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

    // Weighted pool formula: adjust for 80/20 weights
    uint256 symmWeight = 80; // 80% SYMM
    uint256 usdcWeight = 20; // 20% USDC
    usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance * usdcWeight) / (symmBalance * symmWeight);
    usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e12); // Correct decimal adjustment
    lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
}
```
