# A user can avoid the penalty by withdrawing a small amount of Token

### Summary

In the Vesting.sol contract, the _claimLockedToken function calculates the penalty for locked tokens, but this can be bypassed by withdrawing a small token amount since there is no minimum value check. In the following code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290

If the amount is small, the penalty becomes zero due to division.

### Root Cause

The function does not check for a minimum token amount:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281

As a result, an attacker can withdraw a small amount, ensuring that the penalty remains zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290C2-L290C3

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. There are some tokens still locked 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker will determine the amount for which the penalty will be zero and provide that amount when calling the function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L160
This results in the penalty being calculated as zero, even though the user still has locked tokens.

2. The user can repeat this process, withdrawing all the locked tokens without incurring any penalty.









### Impact

The protocol does not receives penalty token when a attacker withdraws locked tokens
