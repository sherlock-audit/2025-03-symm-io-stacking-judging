# An attacker will drain funds through reentrancy in _addLiquidity function

### Summary

The incorrect ordering of external calls and state updates in _addLiquidity will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker can reenter and drain tokens through multiple paths.


### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol:184-185` 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L184-L185' the _addLiquidity function performs unsafe external calls in incorrect order with `usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);` followed by `usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);`, violating the CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern.

### Internal Pre-conditions

  1. Contract needs to have SYMM tokens available.
  2. User needs to have USDC tokens.
  3. PERMIT2 approvals need to be set for the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDC token needs to be a malicious contract capable of reentrancy.
2. Pool needs to be active and have liquidity.

### Attack Path

 1. Attacker deploys malicious USDC token that implements reentrancy in transferFrom.
 2. Attacker calls addLiquidity with specific amounts.
 3. During USDC.safeTransferFrom, the malicious contract reenters _addLiquidity.
 4. Due to still-valid approvals, attacker can:
     - Drain approved SYMM tokens
     - Manipulate LP token calculations
     - Execute multiple unauthorized transfers
  5. Original transaction completes with corrupted state.


### Impact

  The protocol suffers a complete loss of approved tokens. The attacker gains:
  - All approved SYMM tokens
  - Ability to drain multiple users' deposits
  - Manipulation of LP token balances
  - Potential to break internal accounting

      function testReentrancyAttack() public {
          uint256 initialBalance = vesting.balanceOf(address(this));
          
          // Trigger the attack
          vesting.addLiquidity(1000, 0, 1000);
          
          // Verify tokens were drained
          assertLt(vesting.balanceOf(address(this)), initialBalance);
      }
  }
  ```

### Mitigation

1. Implement ReentrancyGuard modifier on addLiquidity and _addLiquidity functions.
2. Follow CEI pattern strictly - move all state changes before external calls.
3. Add zero-address checks for token addresses.
4. Reset approvals to zero before setting new approvals.
5. Consider implementing a pull payment pattern for token transfers.
