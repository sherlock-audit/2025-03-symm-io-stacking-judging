# Reward period can be extended with minimal amount

### Summary
Anyone can call `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` with a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) to extend the reward distribution period. This can result in users receiving fewer rewards within the same timeframe. Additionally, if the attacker calls the function repeatedly before the 7th day, they can indefinitely extend the reward period, preventing users from receiving the totality of their rewards.

### Vulnerability Detail
The `notifyRewardAmount` function in `SymmStaking` contract allows anyone to deposit rewards for whitelisted tokens. While the function checks that the amount cannot be zero, it does not enforce a minimum meaningful amount. As a result, an attacker can deposit a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei) to extend the `periodFinish` time for the reward token.

**How the Attack Works:** 
1. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a whitelisted token and a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei).
2. The `_addRewardsForToken` function is called, which updates the reward distribution parameters
3. The `periodFinish` is always updated to `block.timestamp + duration`, regardless of the amount deposited.
4. By extending the `periodFinish` time, the attacker dilutes the reward distribution over a longer period, reducing the rewards users receive within the same timeframe.
5. If the attacker calls the function repeatedly before the 7th day, they can indefinitely extend the `periodFinish` time, preventing users from receiving the totality of their rewards.

**Example Scenario:**
- Suppose the current reward distribution for a token is:
  - rate = 100 tokens/day
  - duration = 7 days (1 week)
  - periodFinish = block.timestamp + 7 days
  - Total rewards = 700 tokens.
 - On day 5, an attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with `amount = 1 wei`.
 - The `periodFinish` is extended to `block.timestamp + 7 days` (now 12 days from the start).
 - The `rate` is recalculated as `(1 wei + 200 tokens) / 7 days ≈ 28.57 tokens/day`.
 - By day 10, users have received only ~571.4 tokens instead of the expected 700 tokens.
 - The remaining ~128.6 tokens are distributed over the next 2 days (days 10 to 12).
 - If the attacker calls the function again on day 11 with `amount = 1 wei`, the periodFinish is extended to `block.timestamp + 7 days` (now 18 days from the start).
 - The `rate` is recalculated as `(1 wei + 128.6 tokens) / 7 days ≈ 18.37 tokens/day`.
 - By day 18, users have received only ~700 tokens instead of the expected 700 tokens within the original 7-day period.
 - The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely, preventing users from receiving the totality of their rewards.

### Impact
Anyone could extend the reward finish time with a minimum amount, and the users may receive less rewards than expected during the same time period.

### Recommendation
Restrict the notifyRewardAmount function to only authorized entities (e.g., the protocol admin or a governance contract)
