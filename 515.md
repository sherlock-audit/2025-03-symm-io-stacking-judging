# Attacker can bypass slippage protection in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity ()`  to drain funds

### Summary

A missing slippage check in the `_addLiquidity` function allows an attacker to bypass the `minLpAmount` parameter, potentially draining funds from the contract. The slippage check is only applied after liquidity is added, which is too late to prevent losses.

### Root Cause

In `_addLiquidity` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213), the slippage check (`if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();`) is performed after the liquidity is added via `ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional`. This means that if the actual LP tokens received (`lpAmount`) are less than `minLpAmountWithSlippage`, the transaction reverts, but the funds have already been used to add liquidity, leaving the contract vulnerable to front-running or price manipulation.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `addLiquidity` with a small `minLpAmount` (e.g., 1 wei).
2. The contract transfers SYMM and USDC to the router and calls `ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional`.
3. The router adds liquidity, but due to price manipulation or front-running, the actual LP tokens received (`lpAmount`) are much lower than expected.
4. The slippage check reverts the transaction, but the funds have already been used to add liquidity, leaving the contract with fewer LP tokens than expected.

### Impact

Stakers suffer a loss of funds proportional to the manipulated LP token amount.

The attacker gains the difference between the expected and actual LP tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move the slippage check before adding liquidity. For example:
```solidity
require(expectedLpAmount >= minLpAmountWithSlippage, "Slippage too high");
```
