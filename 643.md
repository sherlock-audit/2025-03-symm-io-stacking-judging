# Attacker can prevent distribution of rewards to stakers through frequent reward updates

### Summary

Frequent Reward Updates can lead to rounding down to zero of rewardPerToken resulting in no rewards for Stakers.

### Root Cause

Not scaling the `rewardPerToken` for less decimal tokens like USDC which can round down to zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`totalSupply` of stakes is greater than reward set to be distributed every block.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Assume 5000 USDC tokens are transferred as reward via `notifyRewardAmount`.

2. Reward Rate for this tokens will be: `5000e6 / 1 week`.

3. Every block or every few blocks, Attacker calls stake / unstake to trigger an update of rewards.

4. Reward per token will be:

```solidity


(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply)

```
[Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200)

5. If it's done every 3 blocks (6 seconds):

    * `(6 * reward rate * 1e18) / totalSupply`.
    * As reward rate is: 8300 (approx): `49800e18 / totalSupply`.

6. Now, if total number of tokens user stakes is more than 50k tokens, then this result will round down to zero.

7. As it is round down to zero, none of the reward tokens will be distributed to stakers.

### Impact

Stakers won't receive reward tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Scale the reward tokens like USDC which has 6 decimals to 18 decimals to avoid such scenario.
