# Large Deposit Dilution Impact on Rewards Distribution

*Vulnerability Details* 
The function `rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken)` is responsible for calculating the reward per staked token based on the total staked supply. However, the formula used for reward distribution creates a fairness issue when a new user deposits a large amount of tokens, significantly increasing totalSupply. This dilution results in existing small stakers receiving fewer rewards than expected.

[vulnerable function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194C2-L202C3)
```javascript
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    }
    return
        rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
        (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
            totalSupply);
}
```

The vulnerability arises from the fact that rewardPerToken divides by `totalSupply`, making rewards per token decrease drastically when large deposits are made.

*Impact*
Early small stakers receive fewer rewards than expected when a large deposit significantly increases totalSupply, creating an unfair reward distribution.

*Proof of Concept*
Scenario: Large Deposits Affecting Small Stakers

1 Initial State â€“ Small Stakers Present
- Assume `totalSupply = 100` tokens, and the accumulated rewards are being fairly distributed.
-  A staker who owns 10 tokens expects to receive 10% of the rewards.

2 Reward Calculation Before Large Deposit
 * `rewardPerToken` is computed as:
```javascript
     rewardPerToken = previous perTokenStored + (new rewards * 1e18) / totalSupply;
 ```
* Since totalSupply is small, the rewards per token remain 

3 New Rewards Are Accrued Before Large Deposit

* Assume the protocol accrues 500 reward tokens before the large deposit.

* The original stakers should receive a fair share of these rewards.

* The reward per token before the deposit is:
```javascript
rewardPerToken = previous perTokenStored + (500 * 1e18) / 100;
```
* Small stakers benefit from a higher reward rate.

4 Large Deposit Happens at T+1

*A new user deposits 99,900 tokens, increasing totalSupply to 100,000 tokens.

*The reward per token calculation now divides by 100,000, significantly reducing per-token rewards.

5 Reward Dilution Occurs

* Future rewards are now divided across 100,000 tokens instead of the previous 100 tokens.

* Small stakers who contributed earlier now receive an insignificant portion of future rewards.

6 Unfair Reward Distribution

* The large depositor benefits more from future rewards, even though they just joined.

* The early small staker earns much less than initially expected due to dilution.

* The timing of the deposit creates an imbalance, as rewards accrued before the deposit should have been distributed fairly among existing stakers.

*Recommended Mitigation*
To prevent unfair dilution, consider implementing one of the following mitigations: 
-Use a Weighted Accrual System-

Instead of calculating rewards per token based on totalSupply, use a time-weighted system where stakers accrue rewards based on the duration of their stake before new deposits.
