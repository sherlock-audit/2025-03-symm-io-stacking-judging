# Pending Rewards Accounting Mismatch

### Summary

The `SymmStaking::rescueTokens` function allows withdrawal of reward tokens without updating the `pendingRewards` accounting, creating a mismatch between the contract's actual token balance and its internal accounting state, leading to transaction failures when users attempt to claim rewards.

### Root Cause

The [`rescueTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343) function transfers tokens without updating relevant accounting state:

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```

When reward tokens are withdrawn using this function, the `pendingRewards` mapping is not updated to reflect the reduction in available rewards, creating a mismatch between the contract's actual token balance and the recorded pending rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Token must be added as a reward token via `configureRewardToken`
2. Rewards must be notified via `notifyRewardAmount`, which increases `pendingRewards`
3. Admin calls `rescueTokens` on the reward token

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds USDC as a reward token with `configureRewardToken`
2. Admin notifies 1000 USDC as rewards with `notifyRewardAmount`, which sets `pendingRewards[USDC] = 1000`
3. Users stake tokens and earn USDC rewards
4. Admin calls `rescueTokens(USDC, 1000, adminAddress)` to withdraw all USDC
5. `pendingRewards[USDC]` still equals 1000, but the contract's USDC balance is now 0
6. When users call `claimRewards()`, it attempts to transfer rewards according to `pendingRewards`, but the transfer fails due to insufficient balance

### Impact

Users are unable to claim earned rewards despite the contract indicating they have pending rewards. This breaks a core function of the staking contract and results in users losing their legitimate rewards. Additionally, the contract remains in a permanently broken state as the accounting cannot be corrected without additional functions.

### PoC

```javascript
it("should demonstrate rewards accounting mismatch after rescueTokens", async function () {
    const stakeAmount = e("100");
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), stakeAmount);
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(stakeAmount, user1.address);
    
    const rewardAmount = e("1000");
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount]);
    
    await time.increase(3 * 24 * 60 * 60);
    
    const earnedBefore = await symmStaking.earned(user1.address, await usdtToken.getAddress());
    expect(earnedBefore).to.be.gt(0);
    
    const pendingRewardsBefore = await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdtToken.getAddress());
    expect(pendingRewardsBefore).to.be.gt(0);
    
    const contractBalance = await usdtToken.balanceOf(await symmStaking.getAddress());
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).rescueTokens(await usdtToken.getAddress(), contractBalance, admin.address);
    
    const pendingRewardsAfter = await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdtToken.getAddress());
    expect(pendingRewardsAfter).to.equal(pendingRewardsBefore);
    
    const contractBalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(await symmStaking.getAddress());
    expect(contractBalanceAfter).to.equal(0);
    
    await expect(
        symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
    ).to.be.reverted;
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Update the `rescueTokens` function to prevent withdrawing reward tokens that have pending rewards:

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (isRewardToken[token]) {
        uint256 excessAmount = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - pendingRewards[token];
        require(amount <= excessAmount, "Cannot withdraw pending rewards");
    }
    
    if (token == stakingToken) {
        uint256 excessAmount = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - totalSupply;
        require(amount <= excessAmount, "Cannot withdraw staked tokens");
    }
    
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```

2. Alternatively, if withdrawal of reward tokens is necessary, update pendingRewards accordingly:

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (isRewardToken[token]) {
        uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        
        if (amount > contractBalance - pendingRewards[token]) {
            uint256 rewardsTaken = amount - (contractBalance - pendingRewards[token]);
            pendingRewards[token] -= rewardsTaken;
        }
    }
    
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```
