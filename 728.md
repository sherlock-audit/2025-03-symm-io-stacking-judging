# Attacker will delay reward claiming for all protocol users

### Summary

Attacker will delay reward claiming for all protocol users

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374), it recalculate the rate with a new duration instead of the duration left
```solidity
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```
notice the division is with the total duration all over again. The issue here is that anyone can call `notifyRewardAmount()`, so attackers can basically delay reward claiming for all protocol users.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Anyone can call this

### External Pre-conditions

Anyone can perform this

### Attack Path

- Rewards is going on at a rate of 10 tokens per second and it's remaining 2 days for users to complete claiming their remaining rewards. So in the next two day all rewards will be claimed
- Attackers see this and calls notifyRewardAmount() with an insignificant amount e.g one wei
- This should have no effect on the users however, this is not the case as the reward is now spread for an extra 1 week. Note. Anyone can perform this including competitors

### Impact

Affects all users reward claiming duration

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Either consider adding access control to notifyRewardAmount() or use the remaining time period when recalculating the rate and in setting state.periodFinish, instead of state.duration
