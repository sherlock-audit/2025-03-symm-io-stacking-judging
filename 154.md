# Admin Rug Pull via rescueTokens Function

### Summary

The rescueTokens function allows the contract admin to withdraw any ERC20 token, including the staking token (SYMM) and reward tokens, leading to potential loss of user funds and rewards.

### Root Cause

The rescueTokens function lacks checks to prevent the withdrawal of staking or reward tokens. Admins can maliciously drain these tokens, rugging users. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343)

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.
Contract holds staking or reward tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin acts maliciously or compromised.

### Attack Path

Admin calls rescueTokens with the staking token address and all balances.
Contract transfers tokens to the specified receiver.
Users cannot withdraw staked tokens or claim rewards due to drained balances.

### Impact

Users lose staked tokens and unclaimed rewards.
Complete loss of trust in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks in rescueTokens to disallow withdrawing staking or whitelisted reward tokens:

```solidity
require(token != stakingToken, "Cannot rescue staking token");
require(!isRewardToken[token], "Cannot rescue reward token");
```
