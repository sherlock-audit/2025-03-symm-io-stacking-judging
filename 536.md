# Reward Dilution Exploit Due to Continuous Incentive Addition in Staking Contract


### Summary:
The staking contract allows anyone to add rewards in the form of whitelisted tokens to incentivize staking. However, this mechanism leads to unintended reward dilution when additional incentives are added during an active reward period. If a malicious actor continuously adds small amounts of tokens (e.g., 1 wei) every second, it dilutes the total reward, reducing the amount of rewards distributed to the stakers. This issue allows attackers to manipulate the reward distribution, especially when different reward tokens are being added at different times. This behavior undermines the fairness of the staking rewards, leading to inequitable distributions.

			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; @--> Issue 
		}
 ```

### Root Cause:
The core issue arises from the calculation of the reward rate using the formula:  
`state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;`.

When new rewards are added during the active reward period, they increase the total reward amount without properly accounting for the duration of the new rewards. As a result, the reward rate is spread over a longer period, diluting the incentives for users who have already staked.

This issue is exacerbated when small amounts are continuously added (e.g., 1 wei per second), which artificially reduces the reward rate over the entire duration, leading to a situation where the total reward is diluted and unfairly distributed.

### Impact:
- **Diluted Rewards:** The continuous addition of rewards during an active reward period causes the rewards to be distributed over a longer duration, significantly diluting the actual rewards received by stakers.
- **Exploitable by Malicious Actors:** Attackers can exploit this by adding minimal amounts of rewards over time, which decreases the effectiveness of the staking incentives and distorts the intended reward system.
- **Unfair Distribution:** The reward distribution is not based on actual contributions and staked amounts but rather on the timing and frequency of reward additions, leading to unfair reward allocation.
- **Inaccurate Rewards:** As a result, stakers like Alice, who are supposed to receive the entire reward for staking for a fixed period, will not receive the full amount as expected due to the dilution caused by continuous incentive additions.

### Attack Path:
1. **Malicious User Adds Small Incentives:** A malicious actor continuously adds small rewards (e.g., 1 wei) to the staking contract during an active reward period.
2. **Reward Rate Gets Diluted:** Each time a small incentive is added, the total reward amount increases, and the reward rate is recalculated. This causes the total rewards to be distributed over a longer time period, thus diluting the reward rate.


### Mitigation:
- **Separate Reward Periods:** Enforce a clear separation between the reward calculation periods. Once rewards are set for a period, prevent any modification or addition of rewards for that period. New rewards can only be added to the next reward cycle.
- **Implement Minimum Threshold for Reward Addition:** To prevent continuous, minimal reward additions, introduce a threshold for adding rewards (e.g., a minimum reward amount that must be added).
