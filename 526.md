# Denial of Service via Pending Rewards Prevents Token Disabling

### Summary

The conditional check in the **`configureRewardToken`** function will cause a denial of service for reward token management as an attacker will deliberately inject small reward amounts via **`notifyRewardAmount`** to keep **`pendingRewards`** above the threshold, preventing the admin from disabling the reward token.


### Root Cause

In **[SymmStaking.sol:configureRewardToken**] there is a check that reverts if `pendingRewards` for a token is greater than 10.
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320](url)
 This design flaw allows an attacker to keep `pendingRewards` elevated by repeatedly calling `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal amounts, thereby locking the token in an active state despite it needing to be disabled.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The attacker must hold a whitelisted reward token.

### External Pre-conditions

1.The reward token used is externally approved (whitelisted) for rewards.  


### Attack Path

1.The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a whitelisted reward token, injecting even a small reward amount to ensure that `pendingRewards` for that token becomes greater than 10.  
2. The attacker repeatedly calls `notifyRewardAmount` as needed to maintain the `pendingRewards` above the 10-unit threshold.  
3. When the admin attempts to disable the reward token using `configureRewardToken`, the transaction reverts due to the high `pendingRewards`, effectively locking the token in an enabled state.

### Impact

The admin is prevented from disabling a reward token that may be problematic or exploited, which can lead to a disrupted reward distribution mechanism and potentially open the system to further manipulations or exploitations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the logic in configureRewardToken to allow the admin to disable a reward token regardless of its current pendingRewards, or implement a more flexible threshold mechanism. This will ensure that the admin can manage reward tokens effectively, even if small amounts of rewards are continuously being added.
