# [M-13] MEV Opportunity in Liquidity Addition

## Summary

The liquidity addition mechanism in SymmVesting is vulnerable to MEV extraction through sandwich attacks due to insufficient protection against front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail

In SymmVesting.sol, the liquidity addition functions have inadequate protection against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks:

Code reference: SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213

The MEV vulnerability stems from these factors:

1. The contract uses a quote mechanism (line 172) that queries the current pool state:
```solidity
(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);
```

2. While there is basic slippage protection (line 177), it has limitations:
```solidity
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
```

3. The actual liquidity addition (lines 197-203) is susceptible to front-running:
```solidity
amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
    address(POOL),
    amountsIn,
    expectedLpAmount,
    false, // wethIsEth: bool
    "" // userData: bytes
);
```

4. The slippage check (line 212) is only applied after the transaction has been executed:
```solidity
if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
```

These issues make users vulnerable to sandwich attacks where:
- MEV bots front-run the transaction by adding liquidity to manipulate the pool price
- The user's transaction executes at an unfavorable rate
- The MEV bots back-run the transaction, extracting value

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

1. **Value Extraction**: Users adding liquidity may receive fewer LP tokens than they should due to sandwich attacks.

2. **Higher Slippage**: Even with the default 1% slippage protection, users may experience higher effective slippage due to MEV manipulation.

3. **Poor User Experience**: Users may observe unexpected results when adding liquidity, leading to dissatisfaction.

4. **Loss of Capital Efficiency**: The protocol and its users lose value to MEV extractors, reducing overall capital efficiency.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// SymmVesting.sol:171-213
function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    (uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);

    // Check if usdcIn exceeds maxUsdcIn parameter
    if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();

    uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
    
    // ... token approvals and setup ...
    
    // Call the router to add liquidity - vulnerable to front-running
    amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
        address(POOL),
        amountsIn,
        expectedLpAmount,
        false,
        ""
    );
    
    // ... LP token calculation ...
    
    if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing one or more of the following protections:

1. Use tighter default slippage protection (e.g., 0.5% instead of 1%)
2. Implement a commit-reveal scheme for liquidity additions
3. Support integration with MEV-resistant solutions 
4. Use time-weighted average prices instead of spot prices for quotes
