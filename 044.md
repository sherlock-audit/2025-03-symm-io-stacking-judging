# `_addRewardsForToken` will brick tokens inside the contract

### Summary

`_addRewardsForToken` will brick tokens inside the contract, due to it dividing `amount` by `state.duration` without collecting the leftover.

### Root Cause

`_addRewardsForToken` constantly leaves dust inside the contract when we divide by `duration`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366
```solidity	
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

All of this occurs because we divide  `amount` or `amount + leftover` by `state.duration` without collecting the leftover amount, resulting in small quantities of tokens getting stuck inside the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Weekly rewards are 500e6 USDC:

```markdown
500e6 / (7 * 86400) = 826.71 = 826 (since we round down to the nearest integer) 
(7 * 86400) * 826 = 499.5e6
```

However we will distribute 499.5e6 tokens instead, locking the difference inside the contract. This may not sound much, but it will happen every week for every token, and given that the README state that there are gonna be up to 20 tokens the difference will add up over time.

Note that an attacker can also call this function multiple times with 1 wei in order to round down the real added amounts, where in the above case after an admin adding 500e6 USDC an attacker can call it adding 1 wei multiple times in a row (1 second apart) in order to further round down and lower the rewards by bricking the funds.

### Impact

Fund are stuck.

Technically they can be rescued with `rescueTokens`, but that will need to happen constantly and with every token,  as it happens on every reward cycle. If the admins need to intensifier and rescue tokens every single time a new token is added/removed from the rewards then the contract does not function correctly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store the leftover and assign and add it for next week:


```diff
+		amount += leftoverRewards[token];
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
+			leftoverRewards[token] += (amount + leftover) % state.duration;
		}
```
