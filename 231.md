# A malicious user can freeze reward accrual for stakers.

### Summary

A malicious user can freeze reward accrual for stakers by frequently calling `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei of reward token every block. This resets `lastUpdated` and `periodFinish`, causing the reward calculation's time delta to be zero and halting reward distribution. 


### Root Cause


In `SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken`, the reward period's `periodFinish` is reset to `block.timestamp + duration` each time new rewards are added.

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp; // <-- Issue here
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; // <-- Issue here
}
```

When `notifyRewardAmount` is called frequently (e.g., every block), `lastUpdated` is set to `block.timestamp`, and `periodFinish` is extended to `block.timestamp + duration`. This causes the `rewardPerToken` calculation to compute zero rewards between updates because the time delta (`lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated`) becomes zero.

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    }
    return
        rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
@>>        (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
            totalSupply);
}
```

The `lastTimeRewardApplicable` function will always return `block.timestamp` because `periodFinish` is always greater than `block.timestamp`

```solidity
function lastTimeRewardApplicable(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
@>>    return block.timestamp < rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish ? block.timestamp : rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish;
}
```

Since `lastUpdated` is also set to `block.timestamp` in `_addRewardsForToken`, the time delta (`lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated`) becomes zero, resulting in no new rewards being accrued. This disrupts the linear reward accrual over time, effectively freezing rewards for stakers.


A malicious user can freeze reward accrual by calling `notifyRewardAmount` with **1 wei of USDC (1e6 USDC)** every block. On the Base chain (2-second block time), 1 USDC (1,000,000 wei) allows the attacker to make **1,000,000 calls**, each resetting `lastUpdated` and extending `periodFinish` by 1 week.  

1. **Attack Cost:** 1 USDC = 1,000,000  → Funds **1,000,000 transactions**.  
2. **Block Time:** 2 seconds/block → 1,000,000 blocks ≈ **23 days**.  

**Result:** For **23 days**, stakers earn **zero rewards** while the attacker spends only **1 USDC** to exploit the reward mechanism.

So According to this contest rule:

Could Denial-of-Service (DOS), griefing, or locking of contracts count as Medium (or High) severity issue? To judge the severity we use two separate criteria:

> The issue causes funds to be locked for more than a week.
> The issue impacts the availability of time-sensitive functions (cutoff functions are not considered time-sensitive).

If at least one of these is describing the case, the issue can be Medium. If both apply, the issue can be considered High severity. Additional constraints related to the issue may decrease its severity accordingly.

### Attack Path

- Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a token and a tiny amount (e.g., 1 wei) every block.
- Each call extends `periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + 1 week` and updates `lastUpdated` to `block.timestamp`.
- Between calls, `lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated = 0`, resulting in no new rewards (`rewardPerToken` remains static).
- Stakers stop earning rewards as the contract fails to accrue rewards between malicious updates.


### Impact


Stakers suffer a complete loss of expected rewards during the attack period. The attacker spends only 1 USDC to disrupt the protocol’s reward system for up to 23 days.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Introduce a minimum reward amount threshold in `notifyRewardAmount` to prevent frequent updates with negligible amounts,For example:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    require(tokens.length == amounts.length, "ArraysMismatched");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        require(amounts[i] >= MIN_REWARD_AMOUNT, "Reward amount too low"); // Add minimum threshold
        _addRewardsForToken(tokens[i], amounts[i]);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```
