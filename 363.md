# [High] Missing Access Control in Reward Notification

### Summary

A missing access control check in the reward notification mechanism will cause an unauthorized alteration of the reward state for stakers as an attacker will repeatedly inject arbitrary reward amounts, resetting and inflating the reward rate. This manipulation disrupts the intended reward distribution, ultimately harming stakers.



### Root Cause

- In `contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol` within the `_addRewardsForToken` function, there is no access control check preventing unauthorized calls via `notifyRewardAmount`.
- This oversight allows any actor to invoke the reward update logic, where the critical state variables (`rate`, `lastUpdated`, and `periodFinish`) are recalculated without restrictions.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Any user (attacker) must be able to call** `notifyRewardAmount` **without role restrictions.**
2. **The reward token must be whitelisted** (i.e., `isRewardToken[token]` is `true`) so that the token transfer succeeds.
3. **The attacker must hold a sufficient balance of the reward token and have approved its transfer** to the staking contract.


### External Pre-conditions

1. **The attackerâ€™s reward token balance must be non-zero** and available for transfer.
2. **Network conditions must permit timely execution of transactions,** ensuring the reward state is manipulated effectively (e.g., low congestion and favorable gas prices).


### Attack Path

1. The attacker approves the staking contract to transfer a chosen amount of a whitelisted reward token.
2. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with an arbitrary reward amount. This call triggers the `_addRewardsForToken` function.

3. Inside `_addRewardsForToken`, the following state updates occur:
   - If the current period has ended, the reward rate is set to `rewardRate = amount / state.duration`.
   - If the period is still active, the leftover rewards for the remaining time are added to the new amount, and the rate is recalculated as `rewardRate = (amount + (remainingTime * currentRate)) / state.duration`. 
4. The state variables `lastUpdated` and `periodFinish` are updated:   - `lastUpdated` is set to the current block timestamp.
   - `periodFinish` is reset to `block.timestamp + state.duration`, effectively starting a new reward period. 
5. The attacker may then deposit staking tokens and, with the manipulated high reward rate, claim an inflated share of rewards. If The attacker calls the function with a very low amount then this period finish will never end cause affecting to user.


### Impact

The stakers suffer inaccurate and unfair reward distributions. This vulnerability enables the attacker to extract a disproportionately high share of the reward pool while potentially diluting the rewards for honest stakers, thereby compromising the integrity of the protocol. Additionally, the statement `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;` will delay the staker reward time by constantly resetting the reward period, causing problems to both stakers and the protocol. This continuous extension of the reward period disrupts the expected reward schedule and can lead to unpredictable reward distributions.

### Mitigation

- **Restrict Access:** Modify `notifyRewardAmount` to include a role-based access control modifier (e.g., `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)`) to ensure only authorized users can update reward parameters.
- **Validate Inputs:** Implement additional checks on the reward amount and update logic to prevent abuse and ensure the integrity of the reward distribution process.
