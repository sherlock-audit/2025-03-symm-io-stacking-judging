# When claiming locked tokens through dust amount, penalty may be 0

### Summary

Users can claim and withdraw locked tokens by calling the `claimLockedToken()` function. However, in this case, a 50% penalty occurs for the amount the user wants to withdraw. However, there is no minimum amount for the amount, and because the penalty calculation `((amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18)` is not precise, it can be set to 0 through integer division. An attacker can withdraw locked tokens without penalty by sending multiple requests.

### Root Cause

```solidity
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);
		// 100 
		// 50
		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}

```
The `_claimLockedToken()` function calls the `_claimUnlockedToken()` function to claim the unlocked tokens and then sends the locked tokens that the user wants to withdraw. Here, the penalty is also calculated for this amount value. Since the test sets the lockedClaimPenalty value to 50%, in this case, if the user sets the amount to 1, they can extract locked tokens without paying the penalty. If the token is USDT, 1 token is 1 USDT. That is, 0.5 USDF should be paid as a penalty, but 1 USDT is withdrawn as is without paying the penalty.

### Internal Pre-conditions

empty

### External Pre-conditions

empty

### Attack Path

Set amount to 1 and keep calling the claimLockedToken() function. Withdraw locked tokens without paying the 50% fee.

### Impact

Users can bypass the 50% penalty without paying fees, only paying extremely small amounts of gas fees. It's a financial loss because it neutralizes the benefits that the Vesting protocol could take.

### Mitigation

Calculate the penalty more precisely or check the minimum value of amount when calculating the penalty
