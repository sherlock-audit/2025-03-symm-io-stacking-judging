# addLiquidity will revert in certain cases towards the end of the vesting period

### Summary

Towards the end of the vesting period, In certain situations, incorrect check in `_resetVestingPlan` will not allow users to stake their remaining locked SYMM.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

### Root Cause

`_resetVestingPlans` reverts if `newAmount < unlockedAmount`.

### Attack Path

Alice has 1000e18 SYMM vesting for 5 months.

1. Alice calls `addLiquidity` for 500e18 (50%) of her vested SYMM at the beginning of vesting, and receives 500e18 lp tokens.  SYMM vesting is changed to 500e18 SYMM for 5 months. SYMM_LP vesting is created for 500e18 lp tokens for 5 months.
2. 4 months later, 100e18 SYMM is still locked for Alice. Alice wants to use them all to `addLiquidity`. `_addLiquidityProcess` will attempt to reset her lp vesting to `100e18 + 100e18`, (100e18 locked, and 100e18 added):

which will revert due to the check in `_resetVestingPlans`, because unlockedAmount = 400e18:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

As a result, Alice is unable to utilize her vested `SYMM` for liquidity provision when she wanted to (and which should be allowed by design), and she will be able to LP her SYMM only 1 month later than she intended.

### Impact

DoS: users are unable to use their locked SYMM for liquidity provision in certain situations.

> Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless

### Mitigation

Remove the check: the unlocked rewards are already claimed just before the reset of the vesting.
