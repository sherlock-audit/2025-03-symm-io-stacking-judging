# Malicious actors can continue receiving rewards for de-whitelisted tokens due to missing validation

### Summary

Missing validation in [_updateRewardsStates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L406) will cause continued reward distribution for de-whitelisted tokens as malicious actors can prevent token removal while maintaining reward calculations.

### Root Cause

In `_updateRewardsStates` there is a missing validation check for `isRewardToken[token]` when processing rewards. The function continues to process rewards for tokens in the `rewardTokens` array without verifying if they are still whitelisted.

```solidity
	function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i]; //No validation that token is still whitelisted.
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);
			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Token needs to be initially whitelisted `(isRewardToken[token] = true)`
2. Token needs to be in `rewardTokens` array
3. `pendingRewards[token]` needs to be greater than 10 (tiny amount) to prevent de-whitelisting

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a token they want to manipulate
2. Admin attempts to de-whitelist the token by calling [configureRewardToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312) (token, false)
3. Transaction reverts due to `pendingRewards[token] > 10` check
4. Token remains in `rewardTokens` array
5. `_updateRewardsStates` continues processing rewards for this token in all subsequent staking operations
6. If the token becomes compromised or manipulated, all reward calculations will be affected

### Impact

The protocol suffers from:
1. Unnecessary gas costs from processing rewards for tokens that should be de-whitelisted
2. Potential manipulation of reward calculations if the token becomes malicious
3. Inability to properly remove compromised tokens from the reward system

### Mitigation

Add validation check in `_updateRewardsStates` to verify token whitelist status before processing rewards.
