# Reward Rate Suppression via Minimal Reward Injection at periodFinish

### Summary

The Symm Staking contract allows anyone to call **SymmStaking.sol::notifyRewardAmount**, which updates the reward rate. An attacker can intentionally wait until block.timestamp == state.periodFinish and call **SymmStaking.sol::notifyRewardAmount** with an extremely small reward (e.g., 1 wei). This causes the contract to recalculate the reward rate to a near-zero value, suppressing staking rewards for all users. By repeating this process at every reward period expiration, the attacker can indefinitely block meaningful rewards from being distributed.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability originates from the SymmStaking.sol::_addRewardsForToken function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379

**Key Issues:**

1. No Minimum Reward Enforcement:

    - The function accepts any amount as a valid reward, even 1 wei.

2. Unrestricted Access:

    - Anyone can call notifyRewardAmount, allowing an attacker to influence the reward rate.

3. Timing-Based Exploitation:

    - If called at exactly block.timestamp == state.periodFinish, the contract uses state.rate = amount / state.duration, completely ignoring any prior reward rates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The staking contract relies on notifyRewardAmount to update rewards.

- notifyRewardAmount is publicly accessible (anyone can call it).

- The contract recalculates the reward rate when block.timestamp == state.periodFinish.

- The function does not enforce a minimum reward amount.

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker must monitor the periodFinish timestamp and call notifyRewardAmount at the exact moment when block.timestamp == state.periodFinish.

### Attack Path

1. Monitor periodFinish Using a Bot:

      - The attacker waits until block.timestamp == state.periodFinish.

2. Call notifyRewardAmount with 1 wei:
      - Since block.timestamp == state.periodFinish, the function executes:



```solidity
state.rate = 1 wei / state.duration;
```

This results in an extremely low reward rate.

### Impact

1. Severe Disruption of Staking Rewards:

      -  Honest stakers receive almost no rewards.

2. Loss of User Trust & Platform Integrity:
      -  Users may withdraw their stake, leading to reduced protocol participation.

3. Potential Economic Manipulation:
      -  An attacker could depress rewards for extended periods, then inject a large reward only when they control most of the stake, maximizing their share.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 **Restrict notifyRewardAmount Access**

- Assign REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE to trusted entities for reward distribution.

- Prevents arbitrary external manipulation.
