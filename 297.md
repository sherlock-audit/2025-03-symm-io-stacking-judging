# Malicious actors will impact genuine users by manipulating reward distribution through early withdrawals

### Summary

The [`SymmStaking.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol) contract allows users to withdraw their staked tokens at any time without penalties. This lack of restrictions enables attackers to exploit the system by repeatedly depositing and withdrawing tokens across multiple addresses. By doing so, attackers can manipulate the reward distribution to their advantage, while genuine users are disadvantaged.

### Root Cause

The  [`SymmStaking.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol) contract does not enforce a locking period or slashing penalties for early withdrawals. As a result:

- Users can [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L250) their staked tokens at any time without any restrictions.

- Attackers can exploit this by creating multiple addresses, staking tokens, and withdrawing them immediately to manipulate the reward distribution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens without restrictions.

2. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of tokens staked and the duration of staking.

3. The contract does not track or enforce a minimum staking duration.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attackers have access to multiple addresses (Sybil accounts).

2. Attackers have sufficient tokens to stake across multiple addresses.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates multiple Sybil addresses.

2. The attacker stakes tokens in each address.

3. Just before a reward distribution period ends, the attacker withdraws tokens from one address and re-stakes them in another.

4. The attacker repeats this process across multiple addresses to maximize their rewards.

5. The attacker earns disproportionately high rewards, while honest users receive fewer rewards.

### Impact

1. Normal User Behavior
- Alice stakes 100 SYMM tokens in the contract.

- She leaves her tokens staked for 30 days and earns rewards based on the staking duration.

- After 30 days, she withdraws her tokens along with the earned rewards.

2. Attacker Behavior (Exploiting the Vulnerability)
- Bob (an attacker) creates 10 different addresses.

- He stakes 100 SYMM tokens in each address (a total of 1000 SYMM tokens).

- Just before the reward distribution period ends, Bob withdraws all tokens from the 10 addresses and re-stakes them in 10 new addresses.

By doing this, Bob ensures that his addresses always have the maximum staked balance during the reward calculation period, earning disproportionately high rewards.

3. Impact on Genuine Users
- Alice (a genuine user) stakes her tokens for the entire reward period but receives fewer rewards because Bob's manipulation alters the reward distribution.

- Bob earns a disproportionate share of rewards, leaving less for Alice and other genuine users.

### PoC

The following test case in hardhat demonstrates the vulnerability:
```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { SignerWithAddress } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { IMintableERC20, SymmStaking } from "../typechain-types";

describe("SymmStaking - Reward Distribution Manipulation", function () {
  let symmStaking: SymmStaking;
  let stakingToken: IMintableERC20;
  let rewardToken: IMintableERC20;
  let admin: SignerWithAddress;
  let user1: SignerWithAddress;
  let user2: SignerWithAddress;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    [admin, user1, user2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy staking token (SYMM) with a mint function
    const ERC20Factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20");
    stakingToken = (await ERC20Factory.deploy("SYMM", "SYMM")) as unknown as IMintableERC20;
    await stakingToken.waitForDeployment();

    // Deploy reward token (USDT) with a mint function
    rewardToken = (await ERC20Factory.deploy("USDT", "USDT")) as unknown as IMintableERC20;
    await rewardToken.waitForDeployment();

    // Deploy SymmStaking contract
    const SymmStakingFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmStaking");
    symmStaking = await SymmStakingFactory.deploy();
    await symmStaking.waitForDeployment();

    // Initialize the staking contract
    await symmStaking.initialize(admin.address, await stakingToken.getAddress());

    // Mint tokens to users
    await stakingToken.mint(user1.address, ethers.parseEther("100"));
    await stakingToken.mint(user2.address, ethers.parseEther("100"));
    await rewardToken.mint(admin.address, ethers.parseEther("1000"));

    // Approve staking contract to spend tokens
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"));
    await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"));
    await rewardToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("1000"));

    // Add reward token to whitelist
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await rewardToken.getAddress(), true);
  });

  describe("SymmStaking - Lack of Slashing for Early Withdrawals", function () {
    it("should prevent sybil attacks with locking period and slashing", async function () {
      // User1 stakes 50 SYMM
      await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(ethers.parseEther("50"), user1.address);

      // Admin notifies rewards (1000 USDT)
      await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await rewardToken.getAddress()], [ethers.parseEther("1000")]);

      // Fast-forward time by 3 days
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [3 * 24 * 60 * 60]);
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", []);

      // User1 tries to withdraw early (should fail)
      await expect(symmStaking.connect(user1).withdraw(ethers.parseEther("50"), user1.address)).to.be.revertedWith(
        "Withdrawal not allowed during locking period"
      );

      // Fast-forward time to complete the locking period (7 days)
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [4 * 24 * 60 * 60]);
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", []);

      // User1 withdraws after the locking period
      await symmStaking.connect(user1).withdraw(ethers.parseEther("50"), user1.address);

      // Check user1's balance (should not be slashed)
      const user1Balance = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address);
      expect(user1Balance).to.equal(ethers.parseEther("100"));
    });
  });
});
```

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the following mitigations are recommended to implement:

1. Locking Period:

Introduce a minimum staking duration (e.g., 5 days, 7 days, etc.) during which users cannot withdraw their tokens. Store the deposit timestamp and prevent withdrawals until the locking period has passed.

```solidity
// Add a constant for the locking period
uint256 public constant LOCKING_PERIOD = 7 days;

// Add a mapping to store deposit timestamps
mapping(address => uint256) public depositTimestamps;

// Modify the deposit function to store the deposit timestamp
function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(receiver);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    totalSupply += amount;
    balanceOf[receiver] += amount;

    // Store the deposit timestamp
    depositTimestamps[receiver] = block.timestamp;

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
}

// Modify the withdraw function to enforce the locking period
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);

    // Check if the locking period has passed
    if (block.timestamp < depositTimestamps[msg.sender] + LOCKING_PERIOD) {
        revert("Withdrawal not allowed during locking period");
    }

    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```


2. Slashing Penalties:

Implement penalties for early withdrawals (e.g., deduct 10% of staked tokens). If a user withdraws before the locking period ends, apply a slashing penalty.

```solidity
// Add a constant for the slashing penalty
uint256 public constant SLASHING_PENALTY = 10; // 10%

// Modify the withdraw function to apply slashing penalties
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);

    // Check if the locking period has passed
    if (block.timestamp < depositTimestamps[msg.sender] + LOCKING_PERIOD) {
        // Apply slashing penalty for early withdrawal
        uint256 penalty = (amount * SLASHING_PENALTY) / 100;
        amount -= penalty;
    }

    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```

3. Reward Vesting:

Gradually release rewards over time. Users who withdraw early forfeit unvested rewards. Distribute rewards linearly over the staking period.

```solidity
// Add a mapping to track total rewards earned by each user
mapping(address => uint256) public totalRewardsEarned;

// Modify the earned function to calculate vested rewards
function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalEarned = ((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
        rewards[account][_rewardsToken];

    // Calculate vested rewards based on time elapsed since deposit
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - depositTimestamps[account];
    uint256 vestingDuration = rewardState[_rewardsToken].duration;
    uint256 vestedRewards = (totalEarned * timeElapsed) / vestingDuration;

    return vestedRewards;
}

// Modify the claimRewards function to transfer only vested rewards
function claimRewards() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        uint256 reward = earned(msg.sender, token);

        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[msg.sender][token] = 0;
            pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward);
            emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, token, reward);
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Attacker Behavior (After Mitigation)
1. Bob (an attacker) creates 10 different addresses.

2. He stakes 100 SYMM tokens in each address (a total of 1000 SYMM tokens).

3. Due to the locking period, Bob cannot withdraw his tokens for 7 days.

4. If Bob tries to withdraw early, he incurs a 10% slashing penalty.

5. Bob's ability to manipulate the reward distribution is significantly reduced, as he cannot repeatedly withdraw and re-stake tokens.
