# An attacker can gain unauthorized control over contract initialization

### Summary

The missing _disableInitializers() call in the SymmStaking constructor will allow an attacker to reinitialize the contract, as they can call the initialize() function and modify its configuration.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, the constructor does not include _disableInitializers(), leaving the contract vulnerable to reinitialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract is deployed without calling _disableInitializers().
The attacker has access to call the initialize() function.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The attacker calls initialize() on the SymmStaking contract.
The attacker sets themselves as the contract administrator.

### Impact

An unauthorized user may obtain admin privileges and modify contract settings, which could disrupt normal operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add _disableInitializers(); to the constructor to prevent reinitialization.
