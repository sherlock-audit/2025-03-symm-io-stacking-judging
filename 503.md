# Reward manager in `SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken()` will lock tiny reward amounts for stakers

### Summary

A precision loss in the reward rate calculation in `_addRewardsForToken` will cause minor reward amounts to remain undistributed for stakers as the reward manager notifies small reward amounts, leading to truncated values during integer division.

### Root Cause

In `_addRewardsForToken`, the reward rate calculation uses integer division, which truncates small values. Specifically, the line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374
```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```
truncates the result when `(amount + leftover)` is not perfectly divisible by `state.duration`. This causes tiny reward amounts to be locked in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward Manager needs to call `notifyRewardAmount` to set amount for a reward token to be a small value (e.g., less than `state.duration`).
2. Reward Manager needs to call `notifyRewardAmount` when leftover is also a small value, making (`amount + leftover`) insufficient to cover the full reward period.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The reward token's `state.duration` must be set to a value greater than 1 second (e.g., `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1 weeks`).
2. The reward token's `state.rate` must be low enough that (`amount + leftover`) divided by `state.duration` results in truncation.

### Attack Path

1. Reward Manager calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a small amount for a reward token (e.g., 1 wei).
2. The contract calculates the new `state.rate` as `(amount + leftover) / state.duration`.
3. Due to integer division, the `state.rate` is set to 0 if `(amount + leftover)` is less than `state.duration`.
4. Stakers cannot claim rewards for this token because the `state.rate` is 0, and the tiny reward amount remains locked in the contract.

### Impact

Stakers suffer an approximate loss of tiny reward amounts (e.g., 1 wei or less) per reward token.

The Reward Manager does not gain anything, but the protocol's reputation may suffer due to locked funds.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume:
// - state.duration = 1 weeks = 604800 seconds
// - amount = 1 wei
// - leftover = 0

function testPrecisionLoss() public {
    // Setup
    address rewardToken = address(new MockERC20());
    staking.configureRewardToken(rewardToken, true);

    // Notify small reward amount
    uint256 smallAmount = 1; // 1 wei
    address[] memory tokens = new address[](1);
    tokens[0] = rewardToken;
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
    amounts[0] = smallAmount;
    staking.notifyRewardAmount(tokens, amounts);

    // Check reward rate
    (, , uint256 rate, , ) = staking.rewardState(rewardToken);
    assertEq(rate, 0); // rate is truncated to 0
}
```

### Mitigation

Scale the reward calculation by a multiplier (e.g., `1e18`) to avoid truncation:
```solidity
state.rate = ((amount + leftover) * 1e18) / state.duration;
```
