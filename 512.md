# Precision Loss when adding Rewards

### Summary
The current implementation of `_addRewardsForToken` uses integer division when calculating the new reward rate. This leads to precision loss, as any fractional remainder is discarded. Over repeated reward additions, this cumulative loss can become significant, causing the vault to distribute fewer rewards than intended to users.

### Vulnerability Details
**Affected Code**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370

In `_addRewardsForToken`, the reward rate is recalculated with the following logic:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```
**Precision Loss**:
The expression `amount / state.duration` (and similarly `(amount + leftover) / state.duration`) uses integer division, which truncates any fractional part. For reward tokens with small denominations , this loss of fractional rewards (the residual) is non-negligible.
**Recurring Issue**:
Since this function is called each time new rewards are added, the lost residual from each division is not carried forward. The cumulative effect over multiple reward periods results in a significant shortfall in rewards distributed to users.
**Token Diversity Impact**:
The issue affects any reward token with standard decimal implementations (e.g., USDT, USDC, USDE, WBTC, WETH). As each token may have different scales, the precision loss may vary and lead to unpredictable reward distribution discrepancies.

### Impact
**For Users**:
Users receive less reward than expected over time, as a portion of the intended rewards is lost in each calculation. This discrepancy can reduce user trust and participation.
**For the Protocol**:
The cumulative precision loss can lead to significant financial discrepancies in reward distribution, undermining the incentive structure. In extreme cases, the under-distribution of rewards can affect the overall economic model of the protocol.

### Recomendation
Modify the reward update logic to track the remainder (residual) of the division. A recommended approach is:
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    // Incorporate residual rewards to minimize precision loss
    amount = amount + state.rewardResidual;
    state.rewardResidual = amount % state.duration;
    amount = amount - state.rewardResidual;

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        uint256 totalAmount = amount + leftover + state.rewardResidual;
        state.rewardResidual = totalAmount % state.duration;
        totalAmount = totalAmount - state.rewardResidual;
        state.rate = totalAmount / state.duration;
    }
    
    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
    emit RewardAdded(token, amount);
}
