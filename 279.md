# Attacker Can Indefinitely Extend Reward Period and Reduce Reward Rate for Stakers

### Summary

A flaw in the [`SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366) function allows an attacker to continuously extend the duration of reward distribution while simultaneously reducing the reward rate. This results in legitimate stakers having to wait indefinitely to receive their rewards. The attack is possible because new reward amounts are added to any remaining rewards, and the rate is recalculated based on the extended period. By strategically submitting small reward amounts at optimal intervals, the attacker can exponentially reduce the reward rate while extending the reward period, causing significant delays in reward distribution.

### Root Cause

In the function [`SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366):
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
when a new reward is notified, the contract calculates a new reward rate based on the remaining period and any leftover rewards. If the function is called repeatedly with small amounts of rewards, the rate continues to decrease, and the duration of the rewards extends indefinitely.

Example attack scenario:

#### **Initial Conditions**
- `duration = 604,800` seconds (1 week)
- `initial reward rate = 10 tokens/sec`
- `initial total rewards = 6,048,000 tokens` (10 * 604,800)

---

### **Attack Steps**
#### **Step 1:** Attacker waits until `302,400` seconds remain (halfway through) and calls [`SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) with `1 token`.
- **remaining:** `302,400` seconds
- **leftover:** `10 * 302,400 = 3,024,000` tokens
- **New rate:** `(3,024,000 + 1) / 604,800 â‰ˆ 5 tokens/sec` - **rate is reduced by half**
- **New remaining period:** `604,800` seconds - **users need to wait an extra half a week to claim the same amount of rewards**

---
The attacker can repeat the attack again half-way through, reducing the rate by half and extending the remaining period. 

By continuously attacking, the attacker can exponentially extend the distribution period. The reward rate decreases progressively, making rewards almost impossible to claim within a reasonable timeframe.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward token must have an active reward period.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker has enough funds to submit small reward amounts periodically.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker waits until some part of the reward duration has passed.
2. They call [`SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) with a very small reward amount.
3. The contract recalculates the new rate which is smaller than the initial rate.
4. The rewards period is extended by another full duration (1 week).
5. The attacker repeats the attack, exponentially extending the period while reducing the rate.
6. As the reward rate approaches zero, legitimate users experience indefinite delays in receiving rewards.

### Impact

- **Users experience indefinite delays** in receiving staking rewards.
- **Attack scales exponentially**, meaning rewards may never be fully distributed.
- **Staking incentives are broken**, discouraging participation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

We recommend two possible mitigations. 
1. **Set a minimum threshold for new reward amounts:**
   - Require that any new reward added must be at least a certain percentage of the existing reward balance.

3. **Cap the total reward period extension:**
   - Prevent duration extensions beyond a set multiple of the original duration.
