# Attacker can extend rewards to near infinity and lower the distribution

### Summary

Attacker can lower the distribution by extending rewards to near infinity

### Root Cause

Any user can add rewards, by calling `notifyRewardAmount`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275
```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(...) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		// ...
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

Where when adding he gets the remaining from the lat cycle and his new added ones in order to calculate the new amount. Then a new duration is set for the new calculated amount.
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

However the issue is that an attacker can add 1 wei and extend the already assigned rewards. This will lower the rate and make stakers wait a full week to claim 100% of the rewards. This can be repeated multiple times.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

User to call `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei every few hours.

### Attack Path

1. Admins assign 700e18 special tokens that are gonna be dripped only 1 cycle for the early investors
2. Rewards are then set to 100e18 a day
3. Alice does not like the protocol, so after 12h she calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei of the new token
4. Rewards are now set for 1 week distribution with `650e18 / 7 = 92.8e18` per day (as 50 are already distributed)
5. After another 12h she calls the function and the new rewards are 

```markdown
92.8e18 - (92.8e18 * 50%) = 46.4e18 - already distributed
650e18 - 46.4e18 = 603.6e18 - to be distributed over the next week
603.6e18 / 7 = 86.2e18 - daily rate for the next week
```

Notice how thanks to Alice rewards were distributed at 100 a day for the first 12h, then 92.8, then 86.2 and she can continue to do this and expand the time at which they are claimed and lower the amount claimed.

Note that by expanding the time she is also lowering them even further as with more time more users are passably gonna stake, so instead of the special distribution being over 1 week, it's gonna be over 2 or even 3 and distribute to the stakers that have staked at week 2 or 3, where they wouldn't have received any tokens if Alice was not able to do this exploit.

### Impact

User can extend special rewards for a long time and lower the total distributions by continuously calling this function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't allow users to add rewards.
