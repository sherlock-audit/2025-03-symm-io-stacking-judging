# Attacker can repeatedly decrease the reward rate by adding tiny rewards causing a loss for existing stakers

### Summary

Users can add incentives, which are accumulated by stakers over time. However, the reward rate can be manipulated by an attacker who repeatedly adds small amounts of incentives. This increases the duration required for all rewards to be fully accumulated. As a result, new stakers could join and claim rewards intended for the initial stakers, who should have already accumulated all the rewards.

### Root Cause

Anyone can call [SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292) with a tiny amount of rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There must be at least one reward token.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `SymmStaking::deposit()` to deposit some amount of SYMM tokens.
2. Bob repeatedly calls `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` with a tiny amount of reward tokens to stretch out the rewards continously.
3. A new staker comes in which causes a loss of rewards for Alice as she should have accumulated more rewards for when she was the only staker.

### Impact

Every time the attacker adds 1 wei as an incentive, the rewards get stretched out over an entire `duration`, which means that an attacker can stretch out the rewards continously by sending tiny amounts of tokens, effectively lowering the rewards rate. The rewards that should belong to the stakers could now be accumulated by new stakers as the duration during which the rewards are accumulated is much higher. If stakers withdraw, they should have accumulated more rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding restrictions on who can add amounts of reward tokens. Alternatively, implement a minimum amount of reward tokens that can be added to ensure that the total reward amount is meaningfully increased.
