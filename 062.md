# Missing Access Control in `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` Allows Any User to Dilute Reward Rates and Extend Staking Periods

### Summary

Missing access control in `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` will cause a significant reward rate dilution for stakers as any user can add minimal rewards to extend the reward period and drastically reduce distribution rates in `TokenRewardState`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

In `SymmStaking.sol::notifyRewardAmount` the function lacks access control, allowing any user to call it rather than restricting it to only authorized reward managers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must have at least one whitelisted reward token
2. At least one user must have staked tokens and be earning rewards
3. The current reward period must be ongoing (not yet expired)

### External Pre-conditions

None specific required.

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user stakes tokens in the `SymmStaking `contract
2. Admin configures a reward token and notifies a substantial reward amount (e.g., 10,000 USDT)
3. Time passes halfway through the reward distribution period
4. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a minimal amount (e.g 1 USDT or less)
5. The `_addRewardsForToken` function recalculates the reward rate by combining remaining rewards with the tiny new amount and extending the period by a full duration
6. The reward rate is significantly reduced (by approximately 50%)
7. The reward period is extended by a full duration (e.g., 7 days)

### Impact

Stakers suffer a time-value loss as they must remain staked for a significantly longer period (3.5 additional days in our test) to receive their full rewards. 
This time-value manipulation undermines the protocol's reliability and predictability.

		  // 6. Attacker adds minimal rewards (just 1 USDT)
		  // (made it simple using admin so no need to send usdt to attacker)
		  const attackAmount = BigInt(1_000_000); // 1 USDT with 6 decimals

		  const newPeriodFinish = newState.periodFinish;
		  console.log(`New rate: ${newRate} / New period end: ${newPeriodFinish}`);
		  
		  // Calculate percentage decrease and days extended
		  const rateDecrease = ((Number(initialRate) - Number(newRate)) * 100) / Number(initialRate);
		  const daysExtended = (Number(newPeriodFinish) - Number(periodFinish)) / 86400;
		  console.log(`Attack result: Rate decreased by ${rateDecrease.toFixed(0)}%, period extended by ${daysExtended.toFixed(1)} days`);
		  
		  // 8. Check earnings at original end vs new end
		  // Fast forward to original end time
		  const timeToOriginalEnd = Number(periodFinish) - (await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest')).timestamp;
		  await time.increase(timeToOriginalEnd);
		  
		  const earnedAtOriginalEnd = await symmStaking.earned(user1.address, await usdtToken.getAddress());

		  // 9. Verify that adding a tiny amount significantly impacts rewards
		  expect(Number(newRate)).to.be.lessThan(Number(initialRate));

Test Results:
```text
Initial rate: 16534 / Period end: 1742064409
User earned before attack: 4999.8816 USDT
New rate: 8268 / New period end: 1742366811
Attack result: Rate decreased by 50%, period extended by 3.5 days
User earned at original end: 7500.14132 USDT
User earned at new end: 10000.40106 USDT
```

### Mitigation

Add proper access control to the notifyRewardAmount function to ensure that only authorized managers can modify reward schedules:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // Existing implementation
}
```

This ensures that only accounts with the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` can notify rewards, preventing any potential manipulation by unauthorized users.
