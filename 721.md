# Unintended reverts in `resetVestingPlans` due to flawed condition

### Summary

The `_resetVestingPlans` function in Vesting resets the vesting plan for a user

If vesting period has progressed significantly, 
The current check `amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()` 
can cause unintended reverts in the context of `_addLiquidityProcess`.

### Root Cause

`Vesting.sol`

The `_resetVestingPlans ` function performs a check:
this check ensures that the new `amount` is not less than the unlocked amount.

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Significant period of vesting should have passed, 
so that unlockedTokens() returns an amount greater than the reset `amount` 

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path



Step 1 :
The user has a vesting plan with:

- `amount`: 100 SYMM
- `claimedAmount`: 0 SYMM
- `unlockedAmount()`: 80 SYMM (because the vesting period has progressed significantly)
- `lockedAmount`: 20 SYMM 


Step 2 : 
The user wants to add liquidity using the remaining 20 SYMM `lockedAmount`

- `_addLiquidityProcess` function is triggered
- unlocked SYMM tokens are sent to the user `_claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender)`
- Reduces SYMM lockedAmount by amount 

```solidity
		// Update SYMM vesting plan by reducing the locked amount.
		symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);

```

Step 3 : 
Under this scenario unlockedTokens() returns a value greater than the reset `amount` 
20Symm < 80Symm

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```
and the function reverts




### Impact

Broken Functionality:

Users might be unable to add liquidity and update their vesting plans if the unlockedAmount() is greater than the new amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the following logic , or fix it appropriately
