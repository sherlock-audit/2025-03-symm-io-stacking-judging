# Insufficient Check When Removing Reward Tokens

### Summary

The `SymmStaking` contract allows admins to remove reward tokens from the whitelist even if an active reward distribution period is ongoing. This prematurely halts reward accrual for users, leading to loss of unclaimed rewards for the remaining duration of the reward period. The issue arises from an insufficient check during token removal that fails to account for active reward periods.

### Root Cause

The `configureRewardToken` function allows admins to remove a reward token from the whitelist. However, the check to prevent removal during an active reward period is insufficient. The current logic only blocks removal if pendingRewards[token] > 10, but it doesn't check if there's an ongoing reward distribution (i.e., periodFinish > block.timestamp). 

When a token is removed mid-reward-period, the contract stops updating rewards for that token. Users staking during the active period will lose rewards for the remaining duration, even though they were entitled to them. The pendingRewards check is arbitrary (threshold of 10 wei) and unrelated to the reward period's completion.

```javascript
function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
		>>>	address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
When a reward token is removed, it is excluded from the `rewardTokens` array. The` _updateRewardsStates()` function, responsible for calculating rewards, iterates only over active `rewardTokens`. Thus, rewards for the removed token cease to update.

```javascript
if (!status) {
	>>>		if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}
```
The `pendingRewards` check is arbitrary (threshold of 10 wei) and unrelated to the reward period’s completion. This allows removal even if the token has an active periodFinish.

### Attack Path

```javascript
Steps to Reproduce
## Setup:
- Admin configures a reward token with a 1-week distribution period.

- User stakes tokens to earn rewards.

- Mid-Period Removal:

- After 3 days, the admin removes the reward token using configureRewardToken.

- The removal succeeds because pendingRewards is ≤ 10 (e.g., due to small reward amount).

- Reward Accrual Halts:

- The token is excluded from rewardTokens, so _updateRewardsStates() no longer processes it.

- User rewards freeze at the 3-day mark, even though the period has 4 days remaining.

## Claim Attempt:

- The user claims rewards but receives only the amount accrued up to the removal time (3 days’ worth).
```

### Impact

Severity is high
Loss of User Rewards: Users lose rewards they are entitled to for the remaining duration of the reward period.

### Mitigation

Modify the `configureRewardToken` function to block removal during active reward periods
```javascript
_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

    if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

    isRewardToken[token] = status;

    if (!status) {
        TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

        // Prevent removal if the reward period is still active
        if (block.timestamp < state.periodFinish) {
            revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, state.periodFinish);
        }

        // Prevent removal if pending rewards exceed a minimal threshold (e.g., rounding errors)
        if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) {
            revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
        }

        // Remove token from the rewardTokens array
        uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
                rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[len - 1];
                rewardTokens.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Add token to the rewardTokens array and initialize duration
        rewardTokens.push(token);
        rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
    }

    emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
    }
```
