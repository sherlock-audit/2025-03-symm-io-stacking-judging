# New Stakers Will Receive Inflated Rewards Due to Unreset Tracking

### Summary

When a reward token is removed from the whitelist, its cumulative reward per token (`perTokenStored`) is not reset. If the token is later re-whitelisted, the contract continues using outdated reward values, causing new stakers to receive inflated rewards they didn’t actually earn. This results in an unintended over-distribution of rewards, draining the reward pool faster than expected.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312C2-L336C1

The `SymmStaking` contract uses several mappings to manage staking rewards:

`isRewardToken`: A mapping (`mapping(address => bool)`) that tracks whether a token is whitelisted as a reward token.

`rewardState`: A mapping (`mapping(address => TokenRewardState)`) that stores reward distribution details for each token, including `perTokenStored` (cumulative reward per token), `rate` (reward distribution rate), `lastUpdated` (last update timestamp), `periodFinish` (end of reward period), and duration (reward period length).

`rewards`: A mapping (`mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256))`) tracking earned rewards per user per token.

`userRewardPerTokenPaid`: A mapping (`mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256))`) recording the last reward per token paid to a user.

The issue arises because the `perTokenStored` value in the `rewardState` mapping is not reset when a token is removed from the whitelist via the `configureRewardToken` function. When the token is later re-whitelisted and new rewards are added, this stale `perTokenStored` value persists, leading to incorrect reward calculations.

The `configureRewardToken` function is responsible for adding or removing a token from the whitelist:
```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool whitelistStatus, uint256 duration) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (duration == 0) revert ZeroDuration();
    isRewardToken[token] = whitelistStatus;
    rewardState[token].duration = duration;
    emit RewardTokenConfigured(token, whitelistStatus, duration);
}
```
When a token (e.g., USDT) is removed by calling `configureRewardToken`(USDT, false, newDuration), only `isRewardToken`[USDT] is set to false and `rewardState`[USDT].duration is updated. The `rewardState[USDT].perTokenStored` value (`e.g., 9.998 * 1e18` from a previous reward period) remains unchanged.

When the token is re-whitelisted and new rewards are added via `notifyRewardAmount`, the `_addRewardsForToken` internal function updates the reward state:
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }
    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```
If the previous `periodFinish` has expired (`block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish`), it calculates a new rate based on the new amount and duration. The issue is that the `perTokenStored` value is not reset. If it was `9.998 * 1e18` from the prior period, it remains, and new rewards build on top of it.

The rewardPerToken function calculates the cumulative reward per staked token:
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
        (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
            totalSupply);
}
```
This function adds new rewards (based on rate and time elapsed) to the existing `perTokenStored`. If `perTokenStored` starts at 9.998 * 1e18 instead of 0, a new reward period adding another 9.998 * 1e18 results in a total of 19.996 * 1e18, doubling the intended reward.


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. When a reward token is removed using `configureRewardToken(token, false, duration)`, its `perTokenStored` value in `rewardState` is **not reset**.  

2. When the same token is later **re-whitelisted** using `configureRewardToken(token, true, duration)`, the previous `perTokenStored` value remains instead of resetting to `0`. 

3. When rewards are **notified** via `notifyRewardAmount(token, amount)`, the `_addRewardsForToken` function **builds upon** the stale `perTokenStored` instead of resetting it.   

4. `rewardPerToken(token)` includes the old `perTokenStored` value, **inflating** the total cumulative reward per token.   

5. New stakers **inherit** this inflated cumulative reward per token, causing them to receive more rewards than intended.   


### External Pre-conditions

1. A privileged user with REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE must be able to call configureRewardToken() to remove and later re-whitelist a token.
2. A privileged user must call notifyRewardAmount() after re-whitelisting to add new rewards.
3. New users must deposit SYMM after the token has been re-whitelisted and rewards have been added.
4. If existing stakers withdraw before the new period, they may claim excess rewards, but new stakers will still inherit the inflated reward rate.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `notifyRewardAmount``([USDT], [1000e6])` at t=0, starting a 1000 USDT reward period over 604,800 seconds with perTokenStored = 0.

2. At `t=604,800`, the period ends, setting `rewardState[USDT].perTokenStored` = 9.998 * 1e18 as users earn rewards.

3. At `t=605,000`, admin calls `configureRewardToken(USDT, false, 1e6)`, removing USDT but leaving `perTokenStored` = 9.998 * 1e18.

4. At `t=700,000`, admin calls `configureRewardToken``(USDT, true, 604800)` and `notifyRewardAmount([USDT], [1000e6])`, starting a new period with `perTokenStored` still at 9.998 * 1e18.

5. A new user stakes 10 SYMM at t=700,001, earning ~99.98 USDT instantly due to the inflated rewardPerToken, overpaying beyond the intended 9.998 USDT for the new 1000 USDT period.


### Impact

1. Protocol distributes more rewards than intended, potentially doubling rewards for some users.

2. Early stakers receive disproportionately higher rewards than later stakers due to accumulated perTokenStored values.

3. Protocol's reward treasury depletes faster than projected, potentially causing liquidity issues.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this, `configureRewardToken` should reset `perTokenStored` when a token is removed from the whitelist, ensuring a clean state when it’s re-whitelisted.
