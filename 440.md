# Missing constructor in the contracts.


**Description:** The `Vesting`, `SymmVesting` and `SymmStaking` contracts are missing constructor with `_disableInitializers` function, as written In the openzeppelin docs 

```comment
An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
```

**Impact:** The contract lacks proper initialization protection, allowing an attacker to reinitialize it and assign themselves the `ADMIN_ROLE`. This would enable them to transfer all contract tokens to their own account and perform other unauthorized actions.

**Proof of Concept:**

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add contructor with `_disableInitializers` function 

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
