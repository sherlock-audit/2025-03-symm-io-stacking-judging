# When adding liquidity, the received SYMM LP tokens in vesting may not be locked.

### Summary

When adding liquidity, the received SYMM LP tokens in vesting may not be locked.
Enables converting locked SYMM into SYMM LP tokens by pairing with USDC in a pool, with LP tokens re-locked in vesting. In the _resetVestingPlans() function of SymmVesting.sol, the amount of SYMM_LP tokens must be locked for a certain period of time.

```solidity
function _addLiquidityProcess(
	uint256 amount,
	uint256 minLpAmount,
	uint256 maxUsdcIn
) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
	...
	VestingPlan storage lpVestingPlan = vestingPlans[SYMM_LP][msg.sender];

	address[] memory users = new address[](1);
	users[0] = msg.sender;
	uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
	amounts[0] = lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount;
	// Increase the locked amount by the received LP tokens.
	if (lpVestingPlan.isSetup()) {
		_resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts);
	} else {
		_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
	}
	...
}
```
However, looking at the _resetVestingPlans() function in Vesting.sol, it seems that the LP tokens may not be locked. This is because the resetAmount() function in LibVestingPlan.sol incorrectly sets self.endTime.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222
```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
	if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
	uint256 len = users.length;
	for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
		...
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
		...
	}
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71
```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
	...
	uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
	...
	self.startTime = block.timestamp;
	self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
	...
}
```
In the remainingDuration() function, if the current block.timestamp is greater than self.endTime, it is set to 0. 
```solidity
function remainingDuration(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
	return self.endTime > block.timestamp ? self.endTime - block.timestamp : 0;
}
```
This means that in the resetAmount() function, both self.startTime and self.endTime are set to block.timestamp. Therefore, the SYMM_LP tokens will not be locked. Even if block.timestamp is less than self.endTime, they will only be locked for a short period. 
As a result, the user can claim the SYMM LP tokens without any penalty.

In fact, the amount of LP tokens being reset is greater than the amount that is already locked (line 152 in SymmVesting.sol: amounts[0] = lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount), so the lock time must be increased.
