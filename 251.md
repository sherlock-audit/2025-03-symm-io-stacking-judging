# Repeated Rounding Losses Leading to Unclaimable Funds

### Summary

The rounding behavior in the reward calculation causes a loss of reward tokens for the protocol as users  calling `notifyRewardAmount` are triggering rounding losses, making small amounts of tokens unclaimable.

### Root Cause

In `_addRewardsForToken`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379
And more specifically the calculation in this line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374

introduces a rounding loss due to integer division, causing a small amount of tokens to be left unclaimable after every call. Since this function can be called multiple times, the loss accumulates over time after every call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must allow multiple calls to `notifyRewardAmount`, which it does.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292
2. The reward token must have a decimal-based denomination (e.g., 6 decimals for USDT) for more notable losses, but the losses also occur for tokens with 18 decimals.
3. The integer division in `_addRewardsForToken` must truncate decimals, leading to rounding losses.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users must call `notifyRewardAmount`, the greater the amount they call the function with - the bigger the loses.
2. The protocol must not have an automatic way to reclaim or account for the lost tokens.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `notifyRewardAmount([token], [1000e6])`, triggering rounding:
1000e6 - 1000USDT 
604800 - 7 days in seconds
- 1000e6 / 604800 = 1653.439153
- 1653.439153 * 604800 = 999999999.734
 - Loss: 0.26600003242 tokens ≈ $0.266 (26.6 cents)
2. Another user calls `notifyRewardAmount` again and the problem occurs again while the loss accumulates over time
3. Repeating this process compounds the loss, leading to significant unclaimable tokens.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a continuous loss of small token amounts after every reward distribution update, which become unclaimable, requiring manual intervention:

- Over time, significant funds accumulate as unclaimable tokens.
- While the protocol provides a `rescueTokens` function that can be only called by the main admin to recover such tokens, this should not be considered an acceptable solution. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343-L346
-This function can only be called by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and is intended for emergency scenarios. If the admin is required to use it on a regular basis—such as every week—then the issue becomes part of the protocol’s standard operation rather than an emergency measure. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the reward distribution mechanism, as the protocol should be designed to ensure that all deposited rewards remain fully claimable without requiring manual intervention by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for every staking period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To better handle this issue I recommend to store the remainder and increment the `state.rate` by it to accordingly distribute the remaining amount along with the other tokens without the need of the main admin to interfere.

-Example solution: 

```diff
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; 
+                     remaining = (amount + leftover) % state.duration;
+                     state.rate += remaining / state.duration; // Distribute the remaining amount correctly.
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
