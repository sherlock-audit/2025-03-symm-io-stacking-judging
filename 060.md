# Small rewards will be lost due to precision loss in rate calculation

### Summary

Division before multiplication in reward calculations will cause an economic vulnerability for SymmStaking users as small reward amounts will be rounded down to zero, resulting in complete loss of those rewards for stakers.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:369-375](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L369-L375) the reward rate calculation performs division before multiplication, which can lead to significant precision loss:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```
With the default duration of 1 week (604,800 seconds), any reward amount less than 604,800 units will result in a rate of 0 (due to integer division), effectively dropping those rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward manager needs to call `notifyRewardAmount` with a reward token
2. The amount of reward tokens must be less than the duration period (604,800 for the default 1-week period)


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Reward manager calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a small reward amount (e.g., 500,000 tokens)
2. In `_addRewardsForToken`, the rate is calculated as `amount / state.duration`
3. With duration = 604,800 seconds, the rate becomes 500,000 / 604,800 = 0 (due to integer division)
4. All subsequent reward calculations using this rate will result in 0 rewards
5. The tokens are transferred to the contract but never distributed to users

### Impact

The stakers suffer a complete loss of the small reward amounts. This vulnerability primarily affects rewards with small token amounts relative to the distribution period, which might be common for tokens with high value or during initial reward phases. The lost rewards remain in the contract but cannot be claimed by users.

```typescript
it("VULNERABILITY: Small rewards are lost due to precision loss", async () => {
  // Setup reward token
  const rewardToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20")
    .then(factory => factory.deploy("Reward", "RWD"))
  
  // Whitelist the reward token
  await context.symmStaking.connect(context.signers.admin).configureRewardToken(
    await rewardToken.getAddress(), 
    true
  )
  
  // User stakes tokens
  const stakeAmount = e(1000)
  await symmToken.connect(context.signers.admin).mint(context.signers.user1.address, stakeAmount)
  await symmToken.connect(context.signers.user1).approve(await context.symmStaking.getAddress(), stakeAmount)
  await context.symmStaking.connect(context.signers.user1).deposit(stakeAmount, context.signers.user1.address)
  
  // Add a small reward - should be less than the duration (604,800 seconds)
  const smallReward = 500000n // 0.0005 tokens with 18 decimals
  await rewardToken.mint(context.signers.admin.address, smallReward)
  await rewardToken.connect(context.signers.admin).approve(await context.symmStaking.getAddress(), smallReward)
  
  const tokens = [await rewardToken.getAddress()]
  const amounts = [smallReward]
  await context.symmStaking.connect(context.signers.admin).notifyRewardAmount(tokens, amounts)
  
  // Check the reward rate - it should be 0 due to integer division
  const rewardState = await context.symmStaking.rewardState(await rewardToken.getAddress())
  expect(rewardState.rate).to.equal(0)
  
  // Fast forward to the end of the reward period
  await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [604800]) // 1 week
  await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [])
  
  // User should have earned 0 rewards despite having tokens staked
  const earned = await context.symmStaking.earned(context.signers.user1.address, await rewardToken.getAddress())
  expect(earned).to.equal(0)
  
  // Claim rewards
  await context.symmStaking.connect(context.signers.user1).claimRewards()
  
  // User gets 0 rewards
  const userRewardBalance = await rewardToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1.address)
  expect(userRewardBalance).to.equal(0)
  
  // Tokens remain trapped in the contract
  const contractRewardBalance = await rewardToken.balanceOf(await context.symmStaking.getAddress())
  expect(contractRewardBalance).to.equal(smallReward)
})
```

### Mitigation


Modify the reward rate calculation to handle small reward amounts better by using multiplication before division:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        // Using precision factor to avoid losing small rewards
        state.rate = (amount * 1e18) / (state.duration * 1e18);
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = ((amount + leftover) * 1e18) / (state.duration * 1e18);
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

A more comprehensive solution would be to use a higher precision representation for reward rates:

```solidity
// Use a higher precision for rate storage and calculations
uint256 private constant PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e30;

function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = (amount * PRECISION_FACTOR) / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = ((amount * PRECISION_FACTOR) + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

With these changes, the reward calculations would then need to be adjusted to account for the higher precision factor.
