# Users can lose rewards due to state updates occurring before token transfers in `claimRewards`

### Summary

Incorrect ordering of operations in [claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L265) will cause permanent loss of reward claims for users as the reward state is updated before verifying if the contract has sufficient tokens to complete the transfer.

### Root Cause

In [_claimRewardsFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385) (called by `claimRewards`), the contract updates the user's reward state [rewards[user][token] = 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L391) before attempting the token transfer. If the transfer fails, the user's reward claim is permanently lost while the tokens remain in the contract.

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0; //update reward state
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward); //before transfer
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have accrued rewards (`rewards[user][token] > 0`)
2. Contract needs to have insufficient balance of `reward token`
3. User needs to call `claimRewards()`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User accumulates rewards in token X
2. Contract runs low on token X (could happen if admin withdraws tokens or if token becomes deflationary)
3. User calls `claimRewards()`
4. Contract sets `rewards[user][token] = 0`
5. `safeTransfer` fails due to insufficient balance
6. Transaction reverts but user's reward state is already cleared
7. User permanently loses their reward claim

### Impact

The user suffers a complete loss of their accumulated rewards. The rewards remain stuck in the contract but can no longer be claimed by the user as their reward state has been reset to zero.

### Mitigation

- Add balance checks before attempting transfers
- Add monitoring for reward token balances to ensure sufficient tokens are always available.
