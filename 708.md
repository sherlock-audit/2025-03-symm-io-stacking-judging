# Malicious actor can set reward rate to zero if period is over

### Summary

The _addRewardsForToken function has a vulnerability where, if the inputted amount is zero and the periodFinish has already passed, the reward rate (state.rate) is set to zero. This occurs because the function calculates the new rate using the formula state.rate = amount / state.duration, and dividing by state.duration with a zero amount results in a rate of zero.  This vulnerability wiill affect users that didn't claim their tokens until the end of the staking period

### Root Cause

The _addRewardsForToken function is an internal function so the root cause is from the notifyRewardAmount() which calls it.  The notifyRewardAmount() lacks an acces control mechanism which makes it able for any malicious actor to call it with a zero amount after the staking period is over..  Due to this the reward rate is altered to zero and users that fail to claim all of their rewards before staking period finished are dosed

notifyRewardAmount() below with no access control calls _addRewardsForToken() with a zero input value
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
reconfiguration
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount); //calls 
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

//reward rate is altered to zero if staking period is over
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

	==>	if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {//reward rate is changed to zero if period has finished
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

notifyRewardsAmount() has no access control

### External Pre-conditions

- no offchain mechanism guiding calls to the protocol

### Attack Path

-malicious actor calls notifyRewardAmount() with a zero input value which further calls _addRewardsForToken()
- reward rate is altered to zero in  _addRewardsForToken() 
- users that intend to claim after staking period has finished are Dosed

### Impact

users lose their rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 1. An additional check should be added to ensure that the amount is non-zero before updating the reward rate.
 2.  Put access control in notifyRewardsAmount() function
