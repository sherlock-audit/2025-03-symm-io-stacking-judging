# Admin privileges allow draining of user funds

### Summary

The staking and vesting contracts grant overly broad admin and operator privileges. Specifically, the `rescueTokens` function in the staking contract and forced vesting claims in the vesting contract allow an admin or operator to withdraw funds or force an early unlock with penalty, respectively. This can lead to an attacker draining staked funds or siphoning locked tokens.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:343](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343) the `rescueTokens` function (accessible only by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) lets the admin transfer any token from the contract to an arbitrary address. This includes staked tokens and reward tokens, meaning a malicious or compromised admin key could drain all stakers’ deposits and unclaimed rewards. In the vesting system, the admin (who holds the `SETTER_ROLE` and `OPERATOR_ROLE` by default) can indirectly force release of users’ locked tokens by calling `claimLockedTokenFor` on their behalf. This forces the user’s tokens to be unlocked early and imposes the penalty (50% by default) which is sent to the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` (a recipient set by the admin). An attacker with control of the admin or operator roles could abuse this to siphon value (e.g. if the penalty receiver is the admin’s address, half of users’ locked tokens could be diverted). 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An admin or operator account holds the required role (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `OPERATOR_ROLE`).
2. The contract holds significant user funds (staked tokens or locked vesting amounts).
3. The function (e.g., `rescueTokens` or `claimLockedTokenFor`) is callable without additional authentication beyond the role.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

If the admin account is compromised or malicious, the attacker can invoke `rescueTokens` to transfer all staked SYMM and reward tokens out of the staking contract, effectively stealing users’ deposits and rewards. Similarly, a malicious operator could call `claimLockedTokenFor(user, amount)` for each user’s vesting plan, forcing an immediate unlock. Users would receive only half of their locked tokens, while the rest goes to the penalty receiver (which the attacker might control). This constitutes a centralization risk where a single key can rug the contract.

### Impact

Affected Party: Stakers and vesting participants.
Approximate Loss: All staked funds and a significant portion of locked tokens may be lost; the attacker gains the equivalent value of these tokens.

### PoC

```solidity
// Example pseudocode: Assuming attacker holds admin privileges
// In SymmStaking.sol
stakingContract.rescueTokens(tokenAddress, attackerAddress);

// In SymmVesting.sol, forcing early claim on behalf of a user
vestingContract.claimLockedTokenFor(victimAddress, vestingAmount);

```

### Mitigation

Restrict and secure administrative roles. For `rescueTokens`, consider limiting it to only withdraw unintended tokens (not the core staking token) or removing this function in production. At minimum, use a multi-signature wallet or timelock for the admin role to mitigate single-key risk. If early forced unlock is not an intended feature, remove or further gate the `claimLockedTokenFor` functionality. Ensure the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` is a trusted, secured address (e.g. a treasury contract) and consider requiring user consent for early unlocks initiated by the operator.
