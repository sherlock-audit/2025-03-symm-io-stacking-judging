# Vesting Contract Status Updates Ahead of Token Transfers Lead to Funding Risks

## Summary

Vesting contracts violate the Check-Effect-Interaction model by updating the state before transferring tokens when withdrawing tokens. If the token transfer fails without triggering a rollback, the status may not match the actual situation and the user will not be able to withdraw the due tokens again.

## Root Cause

```solidity
function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();

    // Adjust the vesting plan
@>  totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
@>  vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

    // Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);

@>  IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);

    emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
}
```

Similarly, a similar problem exists in the `_claimLockedToken` function:.

```solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    // Adjust the vesting plan
@>  vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
@>  totalVested[token] -= amount;
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

    // Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

@>  IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
@>  IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

    emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
}
```

The contract updates its status (decreasing totalVested and increasing claimedAmount) before executing the token transfer, and if the token transfer fails without triggering a rollback (e.g., for some non-standard ERC20 tokens), the user's tokens will be shown as withdrawn, but the user did not actually receive them.

## Internal pre-conditions

1. Vesting contracts use normal `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` to transfer tokens
2. The contract performs an external call after a status update, violating the check-effect-interaction model.
3. the contract does not check the return value of the ERC20 transfer operation

## External pre-conditions

1. The ERC20 tokens used return false instead of revert when the transfer fails.
2. the token contract may blacklist or suspend the transfer function for a specific address
3. the token contract may not be fully ERC20 compliant

## Attack Path

1. a malicious operator could create a special ERC20 token that always returns true when transferring money without actually transferring the token
2. Alternatively, the token contract may be attacked or the administrator may blacklist the vesting contract address.
3. the user calls the `claimUnlockedToken` or `claimLockedToken` function
4. the contract updates its status, marking tokens as withdrawn
5. The token transfer fails, but the transaction is not rolled back
6. the user's status shows that the tokens have been withdrawn, but they have not actually been received

## Impact

1. Loss of user funds: users cannot withdraw tokens marked as withdrawn again
2. Status inconsistency: the status recorded by the contract does not match the actual transfer
3. Loss of trust: Users may believe that the contract intends to deceive them.
4. In a batch transfer scenario, a single failed transfer may result in inconsistent status updates for the entire batch.

## PoC

You can create a mock ERC20 token whose transfer function returns true but does not actually transfer tokens, and then use it to test the withdrawal capabilities of the vesting contract.

## Mitigation

1. use the SafeERC20 library's safeTransfer instead of a direct transfer
2. follow the check-effect-interaction pattern to ensure that state updates occur after external calls:

```solidity
function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();

    if (claimableAmount == 0) return;

    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);

    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

    totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
    vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

    emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
}
```

The same modifications should be applied to the `_claimLockedToken` function.
