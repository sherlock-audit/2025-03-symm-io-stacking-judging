# Missing Access Control in `notifyRewardAmount` Function



### Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount` function in the SymmStaking contract lacks proper access control, allowing any external address to manipulate reward distributions. Despite the contract inheriting from AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable and having a defined `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`, this critical function is not protected by the appropriate role check.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275
```solidity
@audit missing access control
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
### Root Cause
The root cause is the omission of the `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)` modifier on the `notifyRewardAmount` function, despite the role being properly defined in the contract:
```solidity
bytes32 public constant REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE = keccak256("REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE");
```

### Internal pre-conditions
- Contract has AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable implemented
- `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` is properly defined
- Other sensitive functions like `claimFor` correctly use role-based access control

### External pre-conditions
- Attacker has enough tokens to transfer to the contract
- The tokens are whitelisted as reward tokens
- Contract is not paused

### Attack Path
1. Attacker identifies a whitelisted reward token they have access to
2. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal amounts (e.g., 1 wei)
3. Each call:
   - Recalculates reward rates
   - Extends the reward period
   - Dilutes rewards for legitimate stakers
4. Attacker can repeat this process frequently to maintain the attack

### Impact

- Manipulation of reward distribution rates
- Extension of reward periods indefinitely
- Disruption of protocol economics
- Potential loss of user trust and participation



### Mitigation
Add the appropriate role check modifier to the function:

```diff
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused
+    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) // Add this modifier
{
    // Existing function body
}
```

This ensures only authorized addresses can notify new rewards and modify reward distribution parameters.
