# Reward Rate Manipulation via Dust Deposits in notifyRewardAmount

### Summary

The notifyRewardAmount function allows users to notify new reward amounts, updating the state.rate for each reward token. However, an attacker can grief the system by sending minimal reward amounts at regular intervals, artificially extending the reward vesting period. This results in a significantly lower reward rate over time, unfairly impacting users who initially staked under a higher rate expectation.

### Root Cause

The function _addRewardsForToken recalculates the reward rate every time a new amount is added. If the period is still active, it accumulates leftover rewards and redistributes them over the whole increased duration. This allows an attacker to frequently deposit dust amounts, causing a continuous drop in the reward rate.

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

There is no minimum reward amount threshold for deposits.
The reward rate (state.rate) is adjusted dynamically whenever a new reward amount is added, even for negligible amounts.
The reward period (state.periodFinish) is extended each time, indefinitely prolonging vesting.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker have dust amount of reward tokens

### Attack Path

A malicious user sends a very small amount of a whitelisted reward token.
The notifyRewardAmount function updates the reward rate, factoring in the remaining rewards and extending the period.
By repeating this process over time, the reward rate drops significantly, reducing expected rewards for legitimate stakers.
This forces existing users to stake for much longer durations to receive the initially expected rewards, making the system unfair and discouraging participation.

### Impact

Reduces the reward rate for all users, unfairly penalizing those who deposited expecting a higher rate.
Causes indefinite vesting extensions, making reward distribution inefficient.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict access to notifyRewardAmount to only authorized addresses  or  Implement a minimum amount requirement for deposits to prevent dust transactions
