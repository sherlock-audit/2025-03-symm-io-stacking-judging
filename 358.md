# Attacker will drain SYMM staking rewards from legitimate users

### Summary

The unrestricted SYMM minting capability in the Vesting contract will cause hyperinflation and reward depletion for stakers as attackers can mint infinite SYMM and stake it illegitimately.

### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol: The _mintTokenIfPossible function mints SYMM tokens without access control checks if the contract lacks sufficient balance during claims.

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to allow automatic SYMM minting during vesting claims is a mistake as the SYMM token’s mint function lacks a MINTER_ROLE restriction.

```solidity
	function _mintTokenIfPossible(address token, uint256 amount) internal override {
		if (token == SYMM) IMintableERC20(token).mint(address(this), amount);
	}
```
code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L258-L260

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. SYMM Token Configuration: The SYMM token’s mint function must be publicly callable (no access control).

2. Vesting Plan Setup: At least one vesting plan must exist for the attacker (could be self-created if SETTER_ROLE is compromised).

### External Pre-conditions

1. SYMM Token Contract: Must implement a mintable ERC20 interface without minter restrictions.

2. Balancer Pool: Must accept SYMM/USDC liquidity (not paused).

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a vesting plan (or exploits an existing one) via setupVestingPlans (if SETTER_ROLE is compromised).

2. Attacker calls claimUnlockedToken(SYMM):
 Triggers _ensureSufficientBalance → _mintTokenIfPossible mints SYMM to the contract.

3. Attacker withdraws minted SYMM via repeated claims.

4. Attacker deposits minted SYMM into SymmStaking.deposit() to earn rewards.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 to drain all reward pools.

### Impact

- SYMM Holders/Stakers: Suffer hyperinflation (SYMM value → $0) and lose all staking rewards.

- Attacker Gains: 100% of staking rewards and newly minted SYMM.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add MINTER_ROLE: Restrict SYMM’s mint function to a trusted address.

2. Remove Auto-Minting: Replace _mintTokenIfPossible with manual funding by admins.

3. Access Control: Add onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) to SymmVesting._mintTokenIfPossible.
