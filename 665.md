# notifyRewardAmount Does Not Properly Handle Ongoing Rewards

### Summary

The notifyRewardAmount function is responsible for setting the reward amount for a new staking period. However, it does not correctly handle ongoing rewards, which can lead to incorrect reward calculations and potential loss of staking incentives.

Currently, when notifyRewardAmount is called while a reward period is still active, the function overwrites the existing reward rate without properly accounting for the remaining rewards that have not yet been distributed.

### Root Cause

A reward period is active with a reward rate already set.
The staking contract has undisbursed rewards from the previous period.
The admin calls notifyRewardAmount(newAmount), expecting it to add new rewards to the ongoing distribution.
The function overwrites the existing reward rate without preserving the remaining rewards from the previous period.
The total rewards available to stakers become lower than expected or inconsistent.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Loss of staking incentives: Users receive fewer rewards than they should.
Unfair distribution: New stakers might benefit more, while early stakers lose rewards.
Reduced trust in the protocol: Users may hesitate to stake if rewards are unreliable.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Modify notifyRewardAmount to include any undistributed rewards in the new reward calculation before updating the reward rate.

function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external onlyOwner updateReward(address(0)) {
    uint256 remainingRewards = (periodFinish > block.timestamp) 
        ? (periodFinish - block.timestamp) * rewardRate  // Calculate undistributed rewards
        : 0;

    uint256 newTotalRewards = reward + remainingRewards;  // Include previous rewards
    rewardRate = newTotalRewards / duration;  // Adjusted reward rate to reflect total rewards

    lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    periodFinish = block.timestamp + duration;

    emit RewardNotified(reward, newTotalRewards, rewardRate);
}
