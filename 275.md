# Precision loss in `rewardPerToken` function due to the low multiplier.

### Summary

In the `rewardPerToken` function, the `perTokenStored` increase is calculated as:  

```solidity
(delta time * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply
```
If `delta time` and `rate` are small while `totalSupply` is large, the increase in `perTokenStored` can become `0` due to integer division truncation. 
This leads to the loss in reward for stakers.

### Root Cause

- `rewardPerToken` function uses [`1e18`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200) as a multiplier, which may not be high enough to prevent truncation when `totalSupply` is large. 
```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
@>			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```
- If `rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate` is very low and `totalSupply` is very high, `delta` becomes 0 due to rounding.

### Internal Pre-conditions

High `totalSupply` and low `rate`, but this constraint is too week (you can see PoC).

### External Pre-conditions

No response

### Attack Path

1. Normal `notifyRewardAmount` happens:
amount = 3000e6 = 3000$
totalSupply = 10000e18
rate = amount / 1 week = 3000e6 / 604800 = 4960
perTokenStored = 0
2. Then, malicious user calls notifyRewardAmount function with non-array, 2 seconds(duration of block in base) later:
perTokenStored = 2 * rate * 1e18 / totalSupply = 0.99206 = 0
3. loss of overall reward amount:
totalSupply * 0.99206 / 1e18 = 9920 wei of USDC = 0.0099$
the loss of overall reward amount is 0.01$ at max.
4. If there is frequent update of `perTokenStored` or malicious attack with deposit and withdraw dust amount, the loss could be accumulated and also be significant loss.

### PoC

Considering the price of SYMM is 0.03$(at max), 10000e18 of `totalSupply` is only 300$(not high and can be real supply).
And also reward amount is 3000$ and this is very high amount against the worth of `totalSupply`.
This means that the constraint for this issue, is too week and the issue has HIGH severity.

### Impact

Loss in reward amount for stakers

### Mitigation

Use a higher precision multiplier (e.g., `1e27` instead of `1e18`) to avoid rounding to zero.
