# Improper Reward Distribution: Period Extension vs Rate Adjustment


## Description
The `_addRewardsForToken` function contains a critical flaw in how it handles additional rewards during an active distribution period. When new rewards are added mid-period, the function incorrectly extends the total reward period by resetting `periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + state.duration` instead of increasing the reward rate for the remaining duration of the current period.

## Vulnerability Details
When rewards are added before the current distribution period ends, the current implementation extends the overall distribution timeframe rather than adjusting the reward rate to distribute the new tokens within the originally intended period. This creates a disconnect between expected and actual reward distribution timing, as users expect new rewards to increase the rate for the current period, not extend the distribution timeline.

## Code snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378

## Impact
This implementation creates several negative consequences:
- Users expecting enhanced immediate rewards will instead receive diluted rewards over an extended timeframe
- Reduces short-term staking incentives as reward rates don't increase proportionally
- Creates unpredictable reward distribution patterns that may undermine user confidence
- Could disrupt time-sensitive protocol operations that rely on consistent reward schedules

## Proof of Concept
1. A staking pool is configured with a 7-day reward period for token `TKN`
2. On day 3, additional rewards are added to the pool
3. Instead of recalculating the reward rate to distribute all rewards over the remaining 4 days, the contract extends the period to 10 days (original 7 days from the time of adding rewards)
4. As a result, the rewards are distributed at a lower rate over a longer period than stakeholders anticipated

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Modify the function to recalculate the reward rate based on the remaining time in the current period rather than extending the period
- Only extend `periodFinish` when adding rewards after the previous distribution period has concluded
- Consider implementing a proportional reward adjustment mechanism that maintains the original end date while properly integrating new rewards
- Add clear documentation about how reward additions affect distribution timelines
