# Division Truncation in Reward Distribution Leads to Unclaimable Tokens and Prevents Token Unwhitelisting

### Summary

Division truncation in the reward distribution rate calculation causes unclaimable tokens to accumulate in the contract. This occurs because the formula amount / duration rounds down, leading to a discrepancy between the notified reward amount and the actual distributed amount. Additionally, this truncation prevents the admin from unwhitelisting reward tokens, as pendingRewards will always exceed the threshold due to unclaimable tokens.

### Root Cause

In case itâ€™s a mistake in the code: In the reward distribution rate calculation (amount / duration), Solidity's division truncation causes a loss of precision. This results in unclaimable tokens accumulating in the contract and prevents the admin from unwhitelisting reward tokens.



### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

The user or protocol notifies a reward amount that is not a multiple of the reward duration or previous remaining amount + new amount is not a multiple of reward duration 

### Attack Path

A user or protocol notifies a reward amount (e.g., 10 USDC).

Due to division truncation, the actual distributed amount is less than the notified amount (e.g., 9.677 USDC).

The unclaimable tokens (e.g., 0.323 USDC) remain in the contract and are added to pendingRewards.

The admin attempts to unwhitelist the reward token but fails because pendingRewards exceeds the threshold (e.g., > 10).

### Impact

Unclaimable Tokens: Some reward tokens remain unclaimable and accumulate in the contract, requiring manual intervention to rescue and renotify them.

Token Unwhitelisting Failure: The pendingRewards balance becomes clogged with unclaimable tokens, preventing the admin from unwhitelisting the reward token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Scale the Rate Calculation: Use a larger scale (e.g., 1e18) when calculating the distribution rate to minimize precision loss.

solidity
state.rate = (amount * 1e18) / state.duration;

2. Handle Excess Balance: Track and handle the excess balance caused by truncation to ensure all tokens are claimable.

solidity
uint256 excess = amount - (state.rate * state.duration);
if (excess > 0) {
    pendingRewards[token] -= excess;
    // Optionally, refund or reallocate the excess tokens
}
