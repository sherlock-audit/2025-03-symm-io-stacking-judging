# Token Loss Issue in _resetVestingPlans Function

### Summary

The _resetVestingPlans function incorrectly resets the vesting amount for users without properly handling the excess locked tokens. This results in **token loss**, where tokens are neither transferred to the user nor accounted for in the contractâ€™s balance.

 

### Root Cause

In _resetVestingPlans, there is a missing check for handling excess locked tokens after resetting the vesting plan. When the vesting plan is reset with a new amount, any surplus tokens that were previously locked are not properly transferred back to the user or accounted for in the contractâ€™s balance, leading to token loss. This missing check causes the contract to lose track of these excess tokens, as they are neither refunded to the user nor returned to the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The _resetVestingPlans function is called with an array of users and corresponding new vesting amounts.
The vesting plans for the users are updated by calling the resetAmount function on the VestingPlan structure.
The total vested tokens for the specific token are updated after resetting the user's plan.

### External Pre-conditions

Users may have unlocked or locked tokens based on their vesting schedules.
The contract holds a balance of tokens for usersâ€™ vested amounts, which may include both unlocked and locked tokens.

### Attack Path

The _resetVestingPlans function iterates through each user and their corresponding new vesting amount.
It first claims any unlocked tokens using the _claimUnlockedToken function, which correctly reduces the total vested tokens and transfers unlocked tokens to the user.
The function then checks if the new vesting amount is smaller than the unlocked tokens already claimed, which prevents a user from being under-allocated tokens.
The excess locked tokens, which are calculated as the difference between the old total locked amount and the new vesting amount, are not transferred to the user.
The excess tokens simply disappear from the totalVested mapping without being returned to the user, leading to token loss.

### Impact

Token Loss: When the vesting amount is changed, any excess tokens are lost and not transferred to the user. This results in the permanent loss of tokens from the system.
Financial Loss: Users may be shorted the tokens they should have received, while the contract loses tokens from its balance.
Contract Integrity: The loss of tokens undermines the contract's credibility and operational integrity.

### PoC

Let's break down the issue with Step-by-Step execution and issue Breakdown:
user = user1
amount = 500 (New vesting amount)

-  Claim Unlocked Tokens Before Reset

```solidity
_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
```
âœ… Calls _claimUnlockedToken to withdraw any already unlocked tokens before modifying the vesting plan.

Inside _claimUnlockedToken
```solidity
VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();
```
âœ… Before this line:

amount = 1000
claimed = 0
claimableAmount = 200 (Assuming 20% vested due to time elapsed)
```solidity
totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;
```
âœ… After claiming 200 tokens:

amount = 1000
claimed = 200
totalVested[token] = X - 200
User receives 200 tokens.

-  Check If New Amount is Less Than Unlocked Tokens

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```
âœ… Ensures that the new vesting amount (500) is not lower than the already unlocked tokens (200). Since 500 > 200, execution proceeds.

-  Save Old Locked Amount

```solidity
uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
```
âœ… Retrieves the current locked amount before resetting:

Locked before reset: lockedAmount() = 1000 - 200 = 800
oldTotal = 800

-  Reset the Vesting Plan

```solidity
vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
```
âœ… The new vesting amount is set to 500, but this does not transfer the excess 300 tokens to the user.

Previously locked: 800
New locked amount: 500
300 tokens are left unaccounted for.

-  Update Total Vested Tokens

```solidity
totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
```
ðŸ”´ Issue Detected

```solidity
totalVested[token] = (X - 200) - 800 + 500
                   = X - 500
```
300 tokens are lost from the system.
The function does not transfer the 300 excess tokens to the user.

### Mitigation

Before resetting the vesting plan, transfer the excess unlocked tokens to the user:

```solidity
uint256 excessTokens = oldTotal - amount;
if (excessTokens > 0) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, excessTokens);
}
```

- Now, the execution flow correctly handles excess tokens:

Claim unlocked tokens (200 tokens â†’ user).
Calculate locked amount before reset (800).
Reset the vesting amount to 500.
Transfer 300 excess tokens to the user.
Update totalVested[token].
