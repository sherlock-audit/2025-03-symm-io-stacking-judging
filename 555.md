# `Vesting::resetVestingPlans()` can be frontrun by a user leading to double spending

### Summary

`Vesting::resetVestingPlans()` will [reset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L233) the vesting amount to the amount sent as argument. If a user manages to frontrun the `SETTER_ROLE` and unlock the full amount, paying a penalty before it settles and then unlock again, they may manage to unlock much more than the `SETTER_ROLE` intended to.

### Root Cause

In `Vesting:233`, the reset amount is not decremented or incremented, but set.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User has 1000 lock tokens and calls `Vesting::claimLockedToken()`, claiming 500 and paying 500 as fee, frontrunning point 2.
2. `Setter` role calls `Vesting::resetVestingPlans()` and sets the vesting amount to 2000.
3. User calls `Vesting::claimLockedToken()` again and claims more 1000 and pays 1000 as fee, getting a total amount of 1500 (including point 1) instead of 1000 only.

### Impact

User steals vested tokens. It's hard to perform this attack on Base so medium is appropriate.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Add increment or decrement to `Vesting::resetVestingPlans()`.
