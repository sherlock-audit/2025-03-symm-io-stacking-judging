# Blacklisted USDC/USDT users can stop the removal of reward tokens

## Summary

In SymmStaking.sol, admin can call `configureRewardToken()` to either whitelist or remove a reward token. However, if a user who has staked tokens is a blacklisted USDC/USDT user, this user cannot claim their rewards. The reward token hence can never be removed.

## Root Cause
If amount in pendingRewards[token] > 10, function will revert:

## Vulnerability Details

1. Alice calls `deposit()` for Bob and stakes 100 SYMM tokens on behalf of Bob. Bob is a blacklisted USDC address.
2. Admin calls `notifyRewardAmount()` and transfers 10 USDC (10e6) to SymmStaking.sol.
3. pendingRewards[USDC] += 10e6 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L288)
4. Now, Bob calls `claimRewards()` to claim his rewards in USDC. However, since he is blacklisted, the safetransfer of USDC in `_claimRewardsFor()` will revert. pendingRewards[USDC] is still 10e6.
5. Now, REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE calls `configureRewardToken()` to remove USDC as a reward token. However, because pendingRewards[USDC] is more than 10, function will revert. USDC cannot be removed/blacklisted.


## Impact 
Even if admin calls `rescueTokens()` to retrieve Bob's USDC rewards, the accounting of pendingRewards[USDC] for Bob cannot be reduced. Hence, `configureRewardToken()` will still fail to remove USDC as a reward token, breaking core functionality of whitelisting/blacklisting reward tokens.


## Mitigation
In `rescueTokens()`, ensure accounting for rescued tokens are implemented correctly for pendingRewards[token].
