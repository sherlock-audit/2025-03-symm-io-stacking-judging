# Rewards manager can not remove a rewards tokens because of dust amount remaining

### Summary

When the rewards manager of `SymmStaking` contract tries to remove a rewards token, the reward token can only be removed when the pending rewards is less than 10 wei. This usually can't be accomplished because of dust amounts of token remaining in the contract.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in [`configureRewardToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) function where it reverts when the pending rewards amount is bigger than 10 wei.

Or, from other perspective, the root cause might stem from [`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366) where it does not count previous dust amount into new rate.

Since 1 weeks of rewards distribution is a great amount of seconds, so there's always dust amounts remaining in the contract, and this dust amount accumulates every time new rewards are notified.

As a result, when the rewards manager tries to remove a rewards token, it always reverts because the pending reward amount must be bigger than 10 wei.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- Let's say 100 USDC rewards have been deposited.
- The reward rate calculation is `100 * 1e6 / 1 weeks = 165`.
- The maximum claimable rewards amount is `165 * 1 weeks = 99.792 USDC`.
- As a result, `208000` remains in the contract which is way bigger than 10.

### Impact

- Rewards token can not be removed by rewards manager.
- Increase overall gas cost for every protocol action because rewards token array will only increase.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- First of all, the previous dust amount has to be accounted for next rewards distribution.
- For next, the dust validation amount has to be increased so that the rewards manager could remove tokens whenever there's dust amount left in the contract.
