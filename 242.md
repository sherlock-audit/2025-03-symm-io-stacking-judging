# Precision Loss in Reward Distribution Leads to Lost Rewards for Stakers

### Summary

A precision loss vulnerability in the reward distribution mechanism causes stakers to lose a small portion of their rewards due to integer division truncation. When rewards are notified, the calculated rate does not account for the remainder, leaving residual funds stuck in the contract. Over time, this results in a gradual accumulation of unrewarded tokens, leading to a continuous loss of yield for stakers.


### Root Cause

The `_addRewardsForToken` function calculates the reward rate using integer division, which truncates any remainder. When the total reward amount isn't perfectly divisible by the reward duration (in seconds), the truncated portion isn't distributed, leaving residual funds in the contract. This precision loss occurs during both initial reward setup and subsequent top-ups, affecting all reward distributions.


```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@>>			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Rewards are notified in amounts that are not perfectly divisible by the reward duration (e.g., 1,000 USDC over 604,800 seconds).  

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. **Initial**: 
   - Admin configures USDC as a reward token with a 1-week duration (604,800 seconds).
   - User stakes 100 SYMM tokens (100e18).

2. **Notify Rewards**:
   - Admin notifies 1,000 USDC (1,000e6) rewards.
   - Contract calculates rate: `1,000e6 / 604,800 = 1,653` (truncated from 1,653.439...).
   - Actual rewards distributed over 1 week: `1,653 * 604,800 = 999,734,400` USDC (999.7344 USDC).

3. **Residual Funds**:
   - Residual amount: `1,000e6 - 999,734,400 = 265,600` USDC (0.2656 USDC) remains in `pendingRewards`.
   - No mechanism exists to redistribute this residual in future periods.

4. **User Claims**:
   - After 1 week, user claims rewards and receives 999.7344 USDC.
   - Residual 0.2656 USDC is permanently stuck unless another reward top-up occurs.


### Impact


**Stakers suffer a continuous loss of reward tokens due to precision truncation. For example, a 1,000 USDC reward results in a 0.2656 USDC loss (`0.02656%` loss per perfectly notified reward). If the notified reward is smaller, the loss percentage increases. For instance, a 10 USDC reward over 1 week results in a rate of `10e6 / 604,800 = 16.53...`, which truncates to 16. The actual distributed reward becomes `16 * 604,800 = 9,676,800`, leaving a residual of `10e6 - 9,676,800 = 323,200` (0.3232 USDC), representing a `3.232%` loss.**

IV. How to identify a high issue:
Direct loss of funds without (extensive) limitations of external conditions. The loss of the affected party must be significant.
Guidelines for Significant Loss:

> Users lose more than 1% and more than $10 of their principal.
> 
> Users lose more than 1% and more than $10 of their yield.
> 
> The protocol loses more than 1% and more than $10 of the fees.

V. How to identify a medium issue:

Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The loss must be relevant to the affected party.

Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless or leading to loss of funds that's relevant to the affected party.
Note: If a single attack can cause a 0.01% loss but can be replayed indefinitely, it will be considered a 100% loss and can be medium or high, depending on the constraints.

Guidelines for Relevant Loss:


> Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their principal. 
> 
> Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their yield.
> 
> The protocol loses more than 0.01% and more than $10 of the fees.

### PoC


```typescript
it("should leave residual rewards due to integer division truncation", async function () {
    // Scenario:
    // 1. User1 deposits 604,800 SYMM (matching 1 week duration)
    // 2. Admin notifies 1,000 USDC reward (not divisible by 604,800)
    // 3. After 1 week, user1 claims rewards but receives only 999.7344 USDC
    // 4. Residual 0.2656 USDC remains stuck in the contract

    const depositAmount = e("604800"); // 604,800 SYMM (1 week)
    const rewardAmount = e("1000", 6); // 1,000 USDC (6 decimals)

    // 1. User deposits
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount);
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address);

    // 2. Configure and notify rewards
    await usdcToken.connect(admin).approve(symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(usdcToken.getAddress(), true);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([usdcToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount]);

    // 3. Wait full duration (1 week)
    await time.increase(604800);

    // 4. Claim rewards
    const balanceBefore = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address);
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards();
    const balanceAfter = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address);
    const claimed = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

    // 5. Verify claimed amount (999.7344 USDC)
    const expectedClaimed = ethers.parseUnits("999.7344", 6); // 999,734,400 (6 decimals)
    expect(claimed).to.equal(expectedClaimed);

    // 6. Check residual in pendingRewards (0.2656 USDC)
    const residual = await symmStaking.pendingRewards(usdcToken.getAddress());
    const expectedResidual = ethers.parseUnits("0.2656", 6); // 265,600 (6 decimals)
    expect(residual).to.equal(expectedResidual);

    // 7. (Optional) Demonstrate residual is not used unless new rewards are added
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([usdcToken.getAddress()], [0]);
    const newRewardState = await symmStaking.rewardState(usdcToken.getAddress());
    expect(newRewardState.rate).to.equal(0); // Residual remains unutilized
});
```


### Mitigation


Track and carry forward the residual amount from integer division in `_addRewardsForToken` to ensure full reward distribution over time.
