# configureRewardToken may be DoSed by any dust amount not claimed by any staker

### Summary

```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
a reward token can not be removed if there's more than 10 wei of pending rewards in that token, which can be done artificially by any user staking dust and never withdrawing it.

### Root Cause

Usage of 		
```solidity
if (!status) {
  if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```


### Attack Path

1. Attacker stakes dust amount
2. Attacker deposits dust amounts of any whitelisted token (if there's no rewards in that token)
3. Attacker is eligible for more than 10 wei of the token as rewards

Because Attacker will never withdraw the dust he deposited, the token can never be removed from rewardTokens

### Impact

Tokens can not be removed from rewardTokens.

### Mitigation

Remove line 320, but give stakers time to claim rewards before disabling the token.
