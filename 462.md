# `unlockedAmount()` Miscalculates Vesting with `self.startTime = 0`, Leading to Incorrect Reset Logic in `_resetVestingPlans`

### Summary

The `unlockedAmount()` function is designed to compute the number of vested tokens unlocked based on the current time relative to a vesting plan’s `startTime` and `endTime`. However, when `self.startTime` is set to 0, it incorrectly assumes the vesting period began at the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970), resulting in an inflated unlocked amount proportional to the current blockchain timestamp. This miscalculation propagates to the` _resetVestingPlans()` function, which relies on `unlockedAmount()` to validate new vesting amounts, potentially blocking legitimate resets or allowing them based on incorrect unlocked values.
 The root issue stems from missing validation to ensure a logical vesting period, such as startTime < `endTime` and a non-zero` startTime`, exposing the protocol to unexpected behavior and economic risks.



### Root Cause

The core issue arises from a lack of proper validation in setting up the vesting schedule, which allows for an illogical configuration where `startTime` is set to 0. When `startTime` is 0, the `unlockedAmount()` function mistakenly interprets this as the vesting period having begun at the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). As a result, the function calculates the elapsed time as the full current blockchain timestamp (i.e., currentTime - 0), and the duration as simply `endTime`. This leads to an exaggerated unlocked token amount that far exceeds the intended allocation. as we can see in the function below 
```solidity
function unlockedAmount(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
		if (currentTime >= self.endTime) return self.amount; 
	@>	if (currentTime <= self.startTime) return 0;
		uint256 duration = self.endTime - self.startTime;
		uint256 elapsed = currentTime - self.startTime;
		return (self.amount * elapsed) / duration; 
	}
```

For example, with a vesting amount of 1000 tokens and an endTime set to one year from now, if startTime is 0, the unlocked amount becomes (1000 * currentTime) / endTime. Given that currentTime represents seconds since 1970, the unlocked amount can inflate to an absurd level (e.g., tens of thousands of tokens), rather than capping at 1000 tokens as intended.

This miscalculation adversely impacts downstream logic in the _resetVestingPlans() function. Specifically, _resetVestingPlans() relies on the value returned by `unlockedAmount()` to ensure that any new vesting amount is not less than what has already been unlocked. With an inflated unlocked value, legitimate vesting plan updates can be blocked, as the function would revert with an AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis() error unless the new amount is set unreasonably high. as we can see in the function below:

```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
	@>		if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```


In summary, the root cause is the absence of necessary validations to enforce a logical vesting period—specifically, ensuring that startTime is non-zero and that startTime is strictly less than endTime.

### Impact

Since the unlocked token amount is vastly overestimated due to the incorrect `startTime`, the `_resetVestingPlans()` function— which uses `unlockedAmount()` to validate new vesting amounts—will fail. It will revert any legitimate attempt to reduce the vesting allocation because the calculated unlocked amount is inflated. This locks the vesting plans in an over-allocated state and prevents proper adjustments.

### PoC


Scenario 1: startTime = 0 with Future endTime
Setup:
Deploy a vesting plan with:
self.startTime = 0

self.endTime = block.timestamp + 1 year (≈ 31.5 million seconds)

self.amount = 1000 ether

Current time (block.timestamp) ≈ 1.7 billion seconds (year 2024).

Execution:
Call `unlockedAmount()`:
elapsed = 1.7e9 - 0 = 1.7e9

duration = (1.7e9 + 31.5e6) - 0 ≈ 1.7315e9

Unlocked amount = (1000 * 1.7e9) / 1.7315e9 ≈ 982 ether.

Attempt to reset vesting to 500 ether via `_resetVestingPlans`.

Result:
Check: 500 < 982 is true, so it reverts with `AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis`.

The reset fails, even though the vesting period has barely started, because the unlocked amount is inflated.

Scenario 2: `startTime` = 0 with Past `endTime`
Setup:
Vesting plan with:
`self.startTime` = 0

`self.endTime` = 1 million seconds (far in the past)

self.amount = 1000 ether

Current time ≈ 1.7 billion seconds.

Execution:
currentTime > self.endTime, so unlockedAmount() returns 1000 ether.

Attempt to reset to 800 ether.

Result:
Check: 800 < 1000 is true, so it reverts.

The plan becomes immutable for reductions due to the immediate full unlock.



### Mitigation

Add checks in the `unlockedmount(VestingPlan storage self)` function:

```diff
function unlockedAmount(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
+             require (self.startTime > 0 );
		if (currentTime >= self.endTime) return self.amount; 
		if (currentTime <= self.startTime) return 0;
		uint256 duration = self.endTime - self.startTime;
		uint256 elapsed = currentTime - self.startTime;
		return (self.amount * elapsed) / duration; 
	}
```
