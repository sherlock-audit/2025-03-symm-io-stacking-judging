# Anyone can dilute reward rate and constantly extend `periodFinish`

### Summary

The lack of access control in `notifyRewardAmount` (`SymmStaking.sol`) can cause dilution of reward rates and an indefinite extension of the reward distribution period for stakers, as anyone can call the function to add minimal rewards.


### Root Cause

In `notifyRewardAmount`, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the function. This allows any user to add rewards, which re-calculates the reward rate and extends the `periodFinish` each time it's called. The re-calculation of the rate in `_addRewardsForToken` divides the total rewards (any given amount + leftover rewards) by the fixed reward duration, which can easily dilute the reward rate if called with a finite reward amount.

[`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L291
):
```solidity
@>	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();


		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];


			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);


			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
    }
```
[`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379):

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];


		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}


		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@>		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward token must be whitelisted (`isRewardToken[token]` must be true).
2. The `notifyRewardAmount` function must be called with a valid token and a non-zero amount.
3. The `periodFinish` timestamp must not have passed (or it will reset the rate calculation).


### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must call `notifyRewardAmount` function with finite amount.
2. The attacker must have sufficient gas to repeatedly call the function to cause more dilution at will.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the staking contract and identifies a reward token with an active reward distribution period.
2. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a finite reward amount (e.g, `1 wei`) for the token.
3. The contract re-calculates the reward rate as `(amount + leftover) / state.duration` where `amount` is the attacker's finite amount and `leftover` is the remaining rewards from the active period.
4. The `periodFinish` timestamp is extended by `state.duration` (i.e, 1 week) and the reward rate lower than the previous (i.e. diluted).
5. The attacker repeats this process to continuously dilute the reward rate and extend the `periodFinish` indefinitely.


### Impact

* Legitimate stakers suffer a significant reduction in their reward rates due to the dilution.
* The reward distribution period is extended indefinitely.


### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Restrict the `notifyRewardAmount` function to only be callable by authorized addresses (e.g., the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` or a reward distributor).
