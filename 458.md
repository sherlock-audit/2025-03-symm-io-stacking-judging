# [Medium] Incorrect Vesting Reset Will Allow Admin to Create Inconsistent Vesting Allocations

### Summary

The lack of a claimed amount validation in the reset function will cause inconsistent state and data corruption for users as an admin will mistakenly reset allocations to values below what users have already claimed.

### Root Cause

In contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol there is a missing check to ensure that new vesting allocations are at least equal to the amount of tokens already claimed by the user. The code only checks against currently unlocked tokens, not against the total claimed tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L118-L124

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A user needs to have claimed tokens in the past, setting `vestingPlan.claimedAmount` to be at least some positive value (e.g., 100 tokens)
- The vesting schedule needs to be in a state where `unlockedAmount()` is lower than `claimedAmount` (e.g., all unlocked tokens have been claimed, so `unlockedAmount() = 0`)
- Admin with `SETTER_ROLE` needs to call `resetVestingPlans()` with a new allocation amount less than the user's `claimedAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

None specific to this vulnerability

### Attack Path

1. User has initially been allocated 200 tokens with a vesting schedule
2. User has already claimed 100 tokens, setting their `claimedAmount `to 100
3. All available unlocked tokens have been claimed, so `unlockedAmount()` = 0
4. Admin mistakenly calls `resetVestingPlans()` with a new allocation of 50 tokens for the user
5. The function checks `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount())` which passes since 50 > 0
6. The vesting plan is reset with `vestingPlan.resetAmount(50)`
7. The contract now has an inconsistent state where `claimedAmount = 100` but the total allocation is only 50
8. Future claim calculations may be incorrect, and accounting across the contract becomes inconsistent

### Impact

The user's vesting data becomes corrupt and inconsistent. This can lead to:
1. Users being unable to claim their rightfully vested tokens
2. Contract accounting becoming incorrect, potentially affecting other users
3. Admin confusion about the actual state of users' vested tokens
4. Potential security issues if other functions rely on the assumption that `claimedAmount` cannot exceed total allocation

            users,
            newAmounts
        );
        
        // Verify the inconsistent state - claimed amount is 100 but total allocation is 50
        plan = vestingContract.vestingPlans(address(tokenContract), user);
        assertEq(plan.totalAmount, 50e18);
        assertEq(plan.claimedAmount, 100e18);
        // This is logically inconsistent! claimedAmount > totalAmount
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `_resetVestingPlans` function to ensure the new allocation amount is at least equal to the amount already claimed:
```solidity
error AllocationBelowClaimedAmount(); //add the new error
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        // Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        
        // Add this check to prevent inconsistent state
        if (amount < vestingPlan.claimedAmount) revert AllocationBelowClaimedAmount();
        
        if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
```
