# Bypass 50% penalty limit by providing liquidity, and purchasing tokens

### Summary

Users that own vested tokens should face 50% penalty in case they withdraw there tokens early.
This can be bypassed by providing liquidity, and purchasing the tokens from the pool, before the penalty receiver can withdraw them.

### Root Cause

**Root Cause:**  
The contract permits users to claim **locked LP tokens**, enabling them to circumvent the intended withdrawal restrictions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

User has vested tokens

### Attack Path

- A user with **100 vested tokens** can provide liquidity by depositing **80 tokens** and **20 USDC**.  
- If the **Balancer pool is empty**, they receive **100 LP tokens** in return.  
- Upon withdrawal, they can redeem **50 LP tokens** for **40 tokens** and **10 USDC**.  
- They can then swap the **10 USDC** for additional tokens from the Balancer pool.  
- This effectively **bypasses the 50% withdrawal penalty** by allowing the user to claim **locked LP tokens**.  


### Impact

The user can bypass important invariant of accruing a 50% penalty on symm withdraws.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow to withdraw LP tokens.
