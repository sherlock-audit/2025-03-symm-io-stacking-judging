# DoS Risk in _resetVestingPlans Function

### Summary

In [`Vesting.sol:222`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222), the `_resetVestingPlans` function in the protocol can be vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Since it processes multiple users in a loop, if even one user triggers a revert, the entire transaction fails. This means that if any user has claimable tokens and hasn’t claimed them, _resetVestingPlans will always revert, making it impossible to execute.

```solidity
	function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
@>			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}

```

### Root Cause

Within `_resetVestingPlans`, the function iterates over multiple users and calls `vestingPlan.resetAmount` for each. Inside `resetAmount`, the following condition is checked:

```solidity
if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
```

If any user has unclaimed tokens, this check triggers a revert, causing the entire loop and transaction to fail. This design prevents the account with `SETTER_ROLE` (admin) from ever successfully calling `_resetVestingPlans` as long as at least one user hasn’t claimed their tokens.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	At least one user has unclaimed tokens.
2.	The admin (holder of SETTER_ROLE) attempts to reset vesting plans using `_resetVestingPlans`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.	The admin calls `_resetVestingPlans` to reset all users’ vesting plans (this function can be triggered by either `resetVestingPlans` or `addLiquidity`).
2.	If any user in the loop has unclaimed tokens, the function encounters `ShouldClaimFirst` and reverts.
3.	As a result, the entire `_resetVestingPlans` transaction fails, preventing the admin from resetting any vesting plans and effectively causing a denial of service for this functionality.

### Impact

The `_resetVestingPlans` function becomes practically unusable.The admin cannot adjust or reset vesting schedules, which may lead to protocol malfunctions or the inability to update token release schedules.Vesting plans that require updates will remain locked and unchangeable indefinitely, potentially freezing essential governance or administrative actions. Functions like addLiquidity that rely on `_resetVestingPlans` may also fail to execute properly, disrupting normal protocol operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Skip Instead of Revert: Modify `_resetVestingPlans` to skip over users who have unclaimed tokens, rather than reverting the entire operation.
- External Claim Check: Perform the claimable balance check outside of the loop and handle such cases separately.
