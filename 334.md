# Incorrect Token Claim Due to Race Condition in Locked Token Reset

### Summary

A race condition in the locked token reset mechanism allows users to claim more tokens than intended. The root cause is the direct balance change during the reset process,  This can lead to users claiming excess tokens if their transaction is executed before the protocol's reset call.

as base has a private mempool, users wont be able to plan this using only onchain methods. howvever this could also happen naturally 

### Root Cause

method of reset introduces race condition 

### Internal Pre-conditions

 The user must have a pending claim for locked tokens.


### External Pre-conditions

The protocol must initiate a reset of the user's locked token balance.

The user's claim transaction must be executed before the protocol's reset transaction.

The user's call to claim locked tokens must be executed before the protocol's call to reset the locked amount.

### Attack Path

Bob sends a transaction to claim all his locked SYMM tokens.

At the same time, the protocol initiates a transaction to reset Bob's locked token balance.

Bob's claim transaction is executed before the protocol's reset transaction.

Bob notices the reset and claims half of the reset amount as well.

### Impact

User Gains Excess Tokens: The user ends up claiming more tokens than allowed, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

Protocol Suffers Loss: The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the excess tokens claimed by the user.

### PoC

consider this scenerio 
bob has 1000 symm tokens locked which he attempts to immediately unlock 
the protocol then wants to reduce this amount to 400 symm 
if bobs transaction is executed first then bob would claim 500 symm with the 400 symm tokens being added after the call 
if bob notices this error before the protocol , he can then claim half the 400 symm tokens as well 

### Mitigation

pass the amount as a modified amount (ie increase or decrease amount) as int256 
eg using the above scenerio 
pass amount as int -600 
when the call attempts to do the addition ie 0 - 600 and then convert back to uint using safemath , it would revert due to underflow
