# Users lose their LP vesting locked token if they decide to vest more later

## Summary
If the user sends their locked SYMM as a liquidity, their Lp vest gets setup. If the user later decides to add more Lp with their left locked amount. They will claim the unlocked Lp, but the Locked one will be lost as the self.amount will be updated to the new amount.

When liquidity is added, any vesting progress on the locked tokens is forfeited as the vesting plan is re-based starting from the current block timestamp. Importantly, the USDC payment required for liquidity remains a separate, non-refundable cost

## Root Cause
The issue is from the design of the `resetAmount` function. It mandates that before a vesting plan can be reset, all claimable (unlocked) tokens must be claimed, and then the vesting schedule must be rebased on the new locked amount. This reset overwrites the previous locked token amountâ€”regardless of whether the previous vesting plan had a higher locked amount.

## Attack Path
1. The `User` has locked Tokens, they decide to use their small portion as liquidity by calling `addLiquidity`, which will require the user to have the LockedTokens and the proper USDC amount. Then that will set up the vesting for them
2. The `User` later decides they want to add more of their Locked Token to the Liquidity by calling `addLiquidity` again, and the same `requirement` will be  (USDC and Locked Amount). But this time, their `setUp` check will be true, which will cause the function `_resetVestingPlans` to be called as their self.amount != 0 ( Previous Lp amount). And also they would have claimed their unlocked Lp Tokens, only locked would be left
3. When `_resetVestingPlans` is called, it will check if the unlocked `LP` is more than the specified amount. which in this case won't be. Then inside `_resetVestingPlans` the function `resetAmounts` will be called.
4. The `resetAmounts` will calculate the remaining duration, then it will update the `vestingPlans[token][user]` objects which includes the updating `amount` to the currently provided one.
5. The problem is when it comes to `claimUnlockedToken` it uses the `unlockedAmount`. which calculates on VestingPlan.amount, which was updated as the later request amount. Which means the locked Tokens were not accounted for.

## Impact
- Users risk losing any accrued vesting progress when the vesting plan resets, as the clock restarts with the new locked amount and the USDC payment required for liquidity addition remains a fixed expense. Users incur this cost every time they trigger a reset, even if it means forfeiting previously accumulated vesting benefits.
