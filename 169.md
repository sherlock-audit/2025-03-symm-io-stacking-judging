# Incorrect USDC Amount Calculation will cause transaction disruption for liquidity providers

## Summary:
An incorrect arithmetic operation in the `getLiquidityQuote` function will cause users to supply more USDC than necessary for liquidity addition. This miscalculation occurs because the function applies the _mulDivUp helper with parameters (usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30), which rounds up even when the division is exact. As a result, a user’s liquidity addition transaction may revert or yield unexpected LP token amounts since they must provide one extra unit of USDC.

## Root Cause:

In contracts `SymmVesting.sol`, within the `getLiquidityQuote` function, the USDC amount is first computed as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L253
```solidity
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```
Then it is adjusted with:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L254
```solidity
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```
When the initial division is exact, this use of _mulDivUp may overcount the required USDC by one unit.

## Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The pool’s live balances for SYMM and USDC yield an exact division in the calculation `(symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance`.
2. The liquidity addition function relies on the output of `getLiquidityQuote` to determine the exact USDC amount to transfer.
3. The `_mulDivUp` helper function is used to adjust for fixed-point scaling, causing upward rounding even in exact cases.

## External Pre-conditions:
1. The pool’s token balances remain constant such that the computed division is exact.
2. Users expect the exact USDC amount based on pool balances and are not prepared to supply an extra unit.

## Attack Path:
1. A liquidity provider calls the liquidity addition function with a specified SYMM amount.
2. The `getLiquidityQuote` function computes the USDC requirement and applies `_mulDivUp`, resulting in an overcount by one unit.
3. The liquidity router receives a USDC amount higher than necessary, causing the transaction to revert or yield fewer LP tokens than expected.

## Impact:
Liquidity providers may face failed transactions or receive unexpected LP token amounts because they are forced to supply one extra unit of USDC. This condition is most likely to occur in stable, low-volatility conditions when pool balances yield exact divisions. Although funds are not directly drained, such operational disruptions can harm user experience and liquidity provisioning.

## PoC:
**Textual Explanation**
When adding liquidity, the contract first computes the USDC amount as:
```ini
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```
Then it adjusts this value using the helper function:
```ini
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```
Under conditions where the division is mathematically exact, the intended result should equal the exact quotient. However, if `_mulDivUp` rounds up when not needed, it returns one extra unit. For example, if the computed value were exactly 1, the function might instead return 2. In that case, a user supplying the “correct” USDC amount would be forced to overpay or face a reverted transaction. 
(Note: This PoC assumes the vulnerability is present if _mulDivUp overcounts by one under exact division.)

**Coded PoC Test**
```solidity
// Pseudocode demonstrating the issue:
// Given: symmAmount, usdcBalance, symmBalance such that:
//   (symmAmount * usdcBalance) % symmBalance == 0
// Then, _mulDivUp returns: (exactResult - 1) / divisor + 1, which is one unit more than the exact value.
```

## Mitigation:
- Adjust the implementation of _mulDivUp (or its usage) so that when the division is exact, no extra unit is added.
- Introduce a conditional check to use standard division when no rounding is needed, ensuring the calculated USDC amount matches the exact requirement.
