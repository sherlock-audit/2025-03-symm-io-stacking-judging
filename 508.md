# Attacker will extend reward periods for stakers

### Summary

A missing access control on the `notifyRewardAmount` function in the SymmStaking contract allows any user to call it. An attacker can repeatedly deposit minimal amounts to continuously reset and extend the reward period, thereby reducing the effective reward rate for stakers.


### Root Cause

- **Issue:** The `notifyRewardAmount` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275 function lacks a role-based access control (e.g., `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)`), unlike other admin functions.
- **Effect:** Every call recalculates the reward rate and resets `periodFinish`, allowing an attacker to extend the reward distribution period with even trivial deposits.
- **Reference:** `SymmStaking.sol:275` in the repository.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The function `notifyRewardAmount` is publicly callable without role restrictions.
2. The contract is not paused.
3. The reward token used is whitelisted.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker holds a minimal amount of a whitelisted reward token.
2. The attacker can send repeated transactions (e.g., daily) with minimal deposits.


### Attack Path

1. **Acquire Tokens:** The attacker obtains a small amount of a whitelisted reward token.
2. **Invoke Function:** The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount(token, minimalAmount)` repeatedly.
3. **Reset Schedule:** Each call recalculates the reward rate and resets `periodFinish` (e.g., extending a 7-day period with each call).
4. **Result:** The reward period is indefinitely extended, and stakers receive rewards at a lower daily rate.


### Impact

- **Stakers:** Experience prolonged reward periods and reduced daily rewards.
- **Protocol:** Suffers operational disruption, as the intended reward schedule is manipulated, undermining staker confidence.


### PoC

1. Deploy the SymmStaking contract with an initial reward period (e.g., 7 days distributing 1000 tokens).
2. After 1 day, the attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a minimal deposit (e.g., 1 token).
3. The contract recalculates the remaining rewards and resets `periodFinish` to 7 days from the attacker's call, extending the period.
4. Repeating this process daily continuously pushes the reward period further, slowing the overall distribution rate.


### Mitigation

- **Access Control:** Add a role restriction (e.g., `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)`) to `notifyRewardAmount`.
- **Minimum Threshold:** Optionally enforce a minimum reward deposit to prevent abuse with trivial amounts.
