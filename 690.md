# Use safeTransfer to prevent silent failures in token transfers

### Summary

The _claimUnlockedToken function uses IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount); for token transfers. However, some ERC-20 tokens do not return a boolean value upon failure, leading to potential silent failures. Using safeTransfer from OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 ensures transfer success and reverts if the transfer fails.

### Root Cause

The contract uses IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);, which assumes that all ERC-20 tokens follow the standard implementation.
Some tokens (e.g., USDT) do not return true/false but instead do not revert on failure, causing silent failures.
If transfer fails, the function continues execution without transferring tokens, leading to incorrect balances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

 A user must have unlocked tokens in the vesting contract.
The contract must hold the claimable amount of tokens.
The user calls a function that triggers _claimUnlockedToken.

### External Pre-conditions

The ERC-20 token used for rewards does not properly implement the standard transfer return value (e.g., USDT).

### Attack Path

A user calls a function that invokes _claimUnlockedToken to withdraw their vested tokens.
The contract executes IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);.
If the token does not follow the standard and fails silently (e.g., USDT), no tokens are actually transferred.
The contract, however, updates claimedAmount as if the transfer succeeded.
The user does not receive their tokens, and the contract is left in an inconsistent state.

### Impact

Users may not receive their unlocked tokens without realizing it.
The contract state (e.g., claimedAmount) updates as if the transfer was successful, leading to inconsistencies.
