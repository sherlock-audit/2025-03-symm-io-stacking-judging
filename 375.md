# Incorrect Reward Rate Calculation After Admin Withdraws and Re-Adds Rewards

## Summary
In the staking contract, when no tokens are staked, rewards are not distributed. The admin can withdraw these undistributed rewards and later re-add them when staking resumes. However, when re-adding rewards via notifyRewardAmount, the _addRewardsForToken function improperly calculates the new reward rate by including previously withdrawn rewards as "leftover." This results in an inflated reward rate, potentially allowing users to claim more rewards than the contract actually holds.

## Root Cause
The issue arises from how leftover rewards are carried forward in _addRewardsForToken:

## Attack Path
- The admin sets a reward amount via notifyRewardAmount(token, X).
- No users stake tokens, so rewards remain undistributed.
- The admin withdraws the rewards.
- The admin later re-adds rewards with notifyRewardAmount(token, Y).
- _addRewardsForToken calculates leftover based on the previous rate, even though those rewards were withdrawn.
- The new rate is artificially higher, allowing more rewards to be claimed than available.

## Impact
Over-distribution of rewards: Users may accrue more rewards than the contract holds.

## Mitigation
Reset state.rate if rewards are fully withdrawn or Implement a check to track actual rewards held in the contract before updating the rate.
