# [H-03] Missing Storage Gap in SymmStaking

## Summary
Missing storage gap in the SymmStaking contract creates a risk of storage collision in future upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
SymmStaking.sol:17-18 inherits from multiple upgradeable contracts but does not include a storage gap.
Code reference: [SymmStaking.sol#L17-L18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L17-L18)

## Impact
Future upgrades that add state variables to parent contracts may cause storage collisions, corrupting state and potentially leading to fund loss.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Inheritance without storage gap
contract SymmStaking is
    ERC4626Upgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable
{
    // State variables
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an appropriate storage gap at the end of the contract:
```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
