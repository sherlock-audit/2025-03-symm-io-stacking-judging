# Unsafe ERC20 Transfers in Vesting Contract Lead to Permanent Fund Loss

---
### **Summary and Impact**  

The vesting contract fails to use the imported SafeERC20 library for token transfers during payout operations. Instead, it relies on the plain ERC20 transfer method, which does not check for a successful execution. This is particularly problematic for tokens like USDT that deviate from the ERC20 standard by returning false instead of reverting on a failed transfer.

Most concerningly, in Vesting.sol, the contract modifies state BEFORE transfers occur, creating an unrecoverable situation when transfers fail silently. Users' tokens become permanently trapped in the contract with no mechanism to reclaim them since the contract's internal accounting shows them as already claimed.

---
### **Vulnerability Details**  

The Vesting contract imports SafeERC20 but then fails to use its safety mechanisms:

```solidity
// In Vesting.sol
import { SafeERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

contract Vesting is Initializable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20; // Library imported but not used for transfers
```

The vulnerable functions are `_claimUnlockedToken` and `_claimLockedToken`, which use unsafe direct transfers after state modifications:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272

```solidity
// In Vesting.sol
function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();

    // State modifications BEFORE transfer
    totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
    vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

    // Unsafe transfer without checking return value
    IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);  // <-- VULNERABLE

    emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
}

// Similarly in _claimLockedToken function
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    // State modifications BEFORE transfers
    vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
    totalVested[token] -= amount;
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

    // Unsafe transfers
    IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);  // <-- VULNERABLE
    IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);  // <-- VULNERABLE

    emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
}
```

**Exploitation path:**

1. User has vested tokens and attempts to claim them (`claimUnlockedToken` or `claimLockedToken`)
2. The contract updates its internal state (reducing `totalVested`, increasing `claimedAmount`)
3. The contract calls `IERC20(token).transfer()` which silently fails for tokens like USDT
4. No revert occurs, so transaction completes "successfully" from the contract's perspective
5. The user receives no tokens, but the contract has recorded them as claimed
6. The user cannot claim those tokens again because the contract thinks they've already been paid out
7. **Funds are permanently lost**

What makes this particularly egregious:

1. The project documentation explicitly states they will use stable-coins like USDT: "These include stable-coins such as USDC, USDT, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM"
2. The contract already imports SafeERC20 but doesn't use it where it's critically needed
3. The fact that state changes happen before transfers means this vulnerability is guaranteed to lead to permanent fund loss

This is not a theoretical issue - USDT is explicitly mentioned in their documentation as a token they plan to integrate with, and it's well-known in the industry that USDT behaves this way.

### **Recommendations**  

The solution is straightforward - use the SafeERC20 library that's already imported. Replace all direct token transfer calls with the safe versions:

```solidity
// In _claimUnlockedToken function, replace:
IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
// With:
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

// In _claimLockedToken function, replace:
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
// With:
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

This ensures the transaction reverts if the transfer fails, preventing the dangerous state where internal accounting is updated but tokens aren't transferred. This change guarantees that either:
1. The entire transaction succeeds with correct state updates AND token transfers, or
2. The transaction reverts completely with no state changes
