# Reset of Vesting Plan will incorrectly remove old tokens from Total Amount

### Summary

Symm vesting allows for users to vest tokens, later they can add tokens to there position, this will reset vesting.
Currently the reset vesting function incorrect deducts the still locked amount from total amount of vested tokens, leading to incorrect accounting.

### Root Cause

Users have the ability to vest tokens.
In case they already have a vesting position, they will reset the vesting schedule.

In the _resetVestingPlans() function, first the already unlocked tokens from the user are claimed.
This reduces total vested amount by the claimed amount.
```solidity

		// Adjust the vesting plan
		totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
		vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

```

After this totalVested is reduced incorrectly by the still vested amount, and correctly increased by the new added amount.
```solidity
uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
```

This will ultimately lead to an revert for the last user that tries to withdraw.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Non

### External Pre-conditions

One user resets there vesting plan

### Attack Path

This simple scenario can cause an incorrect total of vested tokens:  

1. A user stakes 200 tokens.  
   - Total vested tokens = **200**.  

2. After half the time, they stake **101 more** tokens.  
   - **100 tokens unlock**, reducing the vested total: **200 - 100 = 100**.  
   - The user now has **100 vested tokens** and **101 new tokens**.  

3. The new total is calculated as:  
   - **100 (vested) - 100 (unlocked) + 101 = 101**.  

4. If the user tries to withdraw now, the system will attempt to deduct **201 tokens** from the total vested amount, causing a **transaction revert**.

### Impact

In case one user resets there vesting plan, the last user can not withdraw there funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only add amount to the totalvested amount.
