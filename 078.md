# Withdrawal mechanism can be Dos'd with dust withdrawals

### Summary

The `withdraw()` function in the SymmStaking contract does not validate a minimum amount for the amount value, so potential attackers can make many small withdrawal requests like 1e1 for tokens with a decimal of 1e18.

### Root Cause

```solidity
	function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
		totalSupply -= amount;
		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}

```
It checks if it's an integer greater than 0, but there is no minimum balance check. In this case, for a token with a decimal of 1e18, DoS is possible through unlimited calls with extremely small values like 1e1

### Internal Pre-conditions

empty

### External Pre-conditions

 empty

### Attack Path

Continuously request the withdraw() function with small units

### Impact

Therefore, it is possible to prevent other users from withdrawing assets
