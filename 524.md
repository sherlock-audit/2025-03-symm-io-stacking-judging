# `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` underestimates $USDC amounc needed and will lead to reverts

### Summary

`SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` is [as follows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247):
```solidity
function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
	uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
	uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
	uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
	uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

	usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
	usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
	lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
}
```
As can been seen:
1. `usdcAmount`, the $USDC amount needed to add liquidity rounds down.
2. `usdcAmount` rounds up to convert to `1e6` precision, but the calculation in point 1 may round down and this calculation not round up, still having the issue. For example, if the calculation in point 1 rounds down to something like `x * 1e12`, it will not round up.
Thus, for the given amount of `lpAmount`, the $USDC amount may not be enough, which will make the router reverts as it tries to pull too much $USDC.

### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting:253`, it should round up.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` is called to get the $USDC to provide to the `ROUTER` to add liquidity, but the amount is insufficient and it reverts, [see](https://vscode.blockscan.com/8453/0xbA1333333333a1BA1108E8412f11850A5C319bA9) line 728 of the `VAULT` that the `ROUTER` calls. 

### Impact

DoSed `SymmVesting::addLiquidity()`, which is time sensitive as users accrue funds with their lps. Additionally, anyone can trigger this easily by making sure the balances are such that the precision loss happens.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Round up instead.
