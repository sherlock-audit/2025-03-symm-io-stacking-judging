# Rounding Error in Reward Calculation Causes Funds to be Stuck in Contract

### Summary

In the SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken function, if the reward amount is provided with high precision (e.g., 6 decimal places), rounding errors may occur when calculating the new reward rate. This can lead to a portion of the intended rewards being lost and stuck in the contract instead of being distributed to users. If this happens repeatedly, the accumulated lost funds can become significant.

### Root Cause

In the function SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken, the reward rate is calculated based on dividing the amount by the duration. This operation can result in a loss of precision, especially when dealing with amounts that have high precision (such as e6 or e18), causing rounding errors. These rounding errors can cause a portion of the reward amount to be "lost" in the calculation and not properly distributed, effectively locking funds in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An attacker or user calls the SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken function with a reward amount that has high precision (e.g., e6 or e18).
2. The reward amount undergoes division (amount / duration), leading to rounding errors and a potential loss of funds due to insufficient precision.
3. The amount that was intended for distribution to users is instead locked in the contract, effectively reducing the reward pool.

### External Pre-conditions

The reward distribution mechanism needs to account for the smallest possible amounts that could arise from rounding to ensure no funds are left unaccounted for.

### Attack Path

1. A user or attacker calls SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount with a reward amount that has high precision (e.g., 1e6 or 1e18).
2. The contract enters the _addRewardsForToken function, where the reward rate is calculated by dividing the amount by the duration.
3. Because of rounding issues, a small portion of the reward is not distributed and remains stuck in the contract, reducing the total reward amount for users.

### Impact

The depositors may suffer a loss as some of the intended rewards are lost due to rounding errors.
The contract holds these funds indefinitely, as the remaining funds are not distributed properly and are effectively "stuck" in the contract.
100e6/604800 = 165
165 * 604800 = 99.792e6
100e6
99.79e6  = $0.21 loss

99.74e6/604800 = 164
164 * 604800 = 99.187200
99.1872 = $0.47 loss

### Mitigation

Add 
```solidity
state.rate += (amount + leftover) % state.duration;
```
