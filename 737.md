# Attacker will delay rewards distribution

### Summary

Because of distribution duration setting logic attackers can stretch reward distributing period for a long time

### Root Cause

Because state.periodFinish is always set a `duration` further from block.timestamp when calling notifyRewardAmount() attackers can constantly call it with 1 wei of a reward token and dilute the rate at which reward tokens are distributed, stretching the time of distribution for months.
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
>		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Some reward token is being distributed (state.rate>0)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker constantly calls notifyRewardAmount() with 1 wei of the reward token
2. state.rate of the reward token is reduced because the logic constantly sets state.periodFinish a `duration` further from block.timestamp
3. Reward gets distributed way slower, potentially multiple times the initial `duration`

### Impact

The stakers get their rewards way longer than initially planned. Some amount of tokens can potentially be distributed for months or years.
