# Incorrect Scaling in addLiquidityByPercentage Function

### Summary

`SymmVesting::addLiquidityByPercentage` function calculates the percentage wrong, resulting with wrong calculations and thus rendering the feature of adding liquidity by percentage completely broken.

### Details

`SymmVesting::addLiquidityByPercentage` function attempts to calculate the  percentage of a user’s locked tokens that they want to add liquidity as. But in doing so, it makes an error in the calculation, and sends too little amount.

```solidity
    /// @notice Adds liquidity by converting a portion of SYMM vesting into SYMM LP tokens.
    /// @dev Claims any unlocked tokens from SYMM and SYMM LP vesting plans.
    ///      Reverts if the SYMM vesting plan's locked amount is insufficient.
    /// @param percentage The percentage of locked SYMM to use for adding liquidity.
    /// @param minLpAmount The minimum acceptable LP token amount to receive (for slippage protection).
    /// @param maxUsdcIn The maximum amount of USDC that can be used (for price protection).
    /// @return amountsIn Array of token amounts used (SYMM and USDC).
    /// @return lpAmount The amount of LP tokens minted.
    function addLiquidityByPercentage(uint256 percentage, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount)
    {
     =>   uint256 amount = (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, SYMM) * percentage) / 1e18;
        return _addLiquidityProcess(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);
    }
```

Let’s say user’s locked amount of tokens are **200e18** (SYMM token has 18 decimals)

The percentage they want to add liquidity as is **50**

Then the calculation would be

amount = (200e18 *50) /1e18 ⇒ 10_000e18/1e18 ⇒ 10_000

Then, it passes this value to `_addLiquidityProcess`, which is wrong, because 10_000 is not the half of the user’s locked tokens, it should’ve been 100e18

We can cross check the validity of this insight by simply looking at how the basic `addLiquidity` function works.

```solidity
    /// @notice Adds liquidity by converting a portion of SYMM vesting into SYMM LP tokens.
    /// @dev Claims any unlocked tokens from SYMM and SYMM LP vesting plans.
    ///      Reverts if the SYMM vesting plan's locked amount is insufficient.
    /// @param amount The amount of SYMM to use for adding liquidity.
    /// @param minLpAmount The minimum acceptable LP token amount to receive (for slippage protection).
    /// @param maxUsdcIn The maximum amount of USDC that can be used (for price protection).
    /// @return amountsIn Array of token amounts used (SYMM and USDC).
    /// @return lpAmount The amount of LP tokens minted.
    function addLiquidity(uint256 amount, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount)
    {
        return _addLiquidityProcess(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);
    }
```

As you can see, in the standard version `_addLiquidityProcess` called too. And we know that here the amount must be send with the appropriate decimals. E.g. if the user wanted to add 5 tokens, they’d have to pass 5e18, and `_addLiquidityProcess` would take 5e18 as amount, not 5 without the 18 decimals. 

If we check `_addLiquidityProcess` we’ll see that the amount is not scaled anywhere, so it is expected that it comes with its decimals- which `addLiquidityByPercentage` fails to do.

### Impact

`addLiquidityByPercentage` is broken. It will always give the wrong value and add extremely small amount of liquidity than intended. It will never work as it should, ever.
