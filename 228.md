# Missing return value check for ERC20 transfer in Vesting.sol

### Summary

The use of `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` in `_claimUnlockedToken` and `_claimLockedToken` functions in `Vesting.sol` causes potential loss of vested tokens for users because some ERC20 tokens (USDT) do not revert on failure but instead return `false`, leading to silent transfer failures while the contract still updates its state. The protocol is gonna use USDT (as mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/README.md)).


### Root Cause

The vulnerability originates from the way the contract executes ERC20 transfers. Specifically, it imports OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20` library but doesn't use it. Instead, it uses the raw `transfer` function, which does not check for failures in certain ERC20 tokens like USDT.  

The following lines show the incorrect transfer implementation:  

1. Unlocked Token Claiming ([`_claimUnlockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L261))  
   ```solidity
   272: IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
   ```  

2. Locked Token Claiming ([`_claimLockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281)) 
   ```solidity
   295: IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
   296: IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
   ```  

The contract assumes these transfers always succeed, but USDT return `false` on failure instead of reverting, leading to incorrect state updates.  
 
The contract does import `SafeERC20` from OpenZeppelin but fails to use it in the critical transfer functions.  
```solidity
 7: import { SafeERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
```  

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract interacts with an ERC20 token that does not revert on failure but returns `false` (such as USDT).  
2. The contract does not check the return value of `transfer`, assuming all transfers succeed.  
3. SafeERC20 is imported but not utilized, indicating an incomplete implementation.  
4. Users attempt to claim their vested tokens using `_claimUnlockedToken` or `_claimLockedToken`.  

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol integrates USDT or similar ERC20 tokens.  
2. The underlying USDT contract has transfer restrictions that could cause failures.  
3. The transfer fails but does not revert, leading to silent failures. 

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `_claimUnlockedToken` or `_claimLockedToken` to withdraw vested USDT tokens.  
2. The contract blindly calls `IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);` without verifying success.  
3. If USDT fails the transfer, it returns `false` instead of reverting.  
4. The contract assumes success and updates the internal vesting state.  
5. The user does not receive their tokens, and they remain stuck in the contract.  
6. The contract considers the claim as processed, preventing further attempts.  
7. The user permanently loses access to their vested funds.

### Impact

- Users suffer permanent loss of their vested tokens due to silent failures.  
- Funds remain stuck inside the contract indefinitely.  
- High risk of reputational damage for the protocol due to users being unable to claim their funds.  
- Possible regulatory concerns since USDT is explicitly supported by the protocol.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer` in `_claimUnlockedToken` and `_claimLockedToken` functions:
- In `_claimUnlockedToken`
    ```solidity
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);
    ```
- In `_claimLockedToken`
    ```solidity
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
    ```
