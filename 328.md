# Admin will be unable to remove token from the whitelist

### Summary

The arbitrary threshold of 10 units for pendingRewards in SymmStaking.sol will cause a denial of service for the admin as the admin will be unable to remove a token from the whitelist when pendingRewards exceeds this trivial threshold, particularly for low-decimal tokens like USDC.



### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, the configureRewardToken function includes a hardcoded check that prevents token removal from the whitelist if pendingRewards[token] exceeds 10 units:
solidity
```solidity
	   // SymmStaking.sol: Arbitrary threshold
     if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(...);
```



This fixed threshold of 10 does not account for the decimals of the token. For tokens with low decimals (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals), even a small reward amount (e.g., 100 USDC = 100 * 10^6 units) far exceeds this limit, making it nearly impossible for the admin to remove the token from the whitelist once rewards are notified.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The following conditions must be met for this vulnerability to manifest:
1. [Admin needs to call configureRewardToken] to set status to be exactly true, adding the token to the whitelist.

2. [Admin or reward manager needs to call notifyRewardAmount] to set pendingRewards[token] to be at least 11, accumulating rewards for the token (e.g., 100 USDC for a 6-decimal token).

3. [Admin needs to call configureRewardToken] to set status to be exactly false, attempting to remove the token from the whitelist, which triggers the revert.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This is a vulnerability path rather than a traditional attack, as it prevents the admin from performing a legitimate action. Hereâ€™s how it unfolds:
1. Admin calls configureRewardToken(token, true): Adds a token (e.g., USDC) to the whitelist.

2. Admin or reward manager calls notifyRewardAmount(token, amount): Notifies a reward amount for the token, setting pendingRewards[token] to a value greater than 10 (e.g., 100 USDC = 100 * 10^6 units).

3. Admin calls configureRewardToken(token, false): Attempts to remove the token from the whitelist.

4. Transaction reverts: The check if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) triggers a revert with OngoingRewardPeriodForToken, blocking the removal.

5. Admin cannot proceed: The token remains on the whitelist until pendingRewards[token] drops below 10, which may be impractical or impossible for low-decimal tokens.



### Impact

The admin cannot remove the token from the whitelist, leading to:
Affected Party: The admin or protocol governance.

Consequences: The admin loses the ability to effectively manage the whitelist, potentially leaving undesired tokens active or complicating reward distribution. While no direct financial loss occurs, operational inefficiencies or unintended reward payouts may result.

Likelihood: High. For tokens with low decimals (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals), even small reward amounts trivially exceed the 10-unit threshold, making this issue almost certain to occur in practice.

Impact: Medium. The vulnerability disrupts administrative control but does not cause direct financial harm or compromise user funds.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this vulnerability, the fixed threshold should be replaced with a more flexible approach. Suggested fixes include:
Percentage-based threshold: Allow token removal if pendingRewards[token] is less than a small percentage (e.g., 0.1%) of the total supply or total rewards. Example:
solidity

uint256 threshold = (totalSupply > 0) ? (pendingRewards[token] * 1e18) / totalSupply : 0;
if (threshold > 1e15) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(...);  // 0.1%
