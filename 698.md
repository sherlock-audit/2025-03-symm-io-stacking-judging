# Wrong calculation of new `rate` of reward state will make loss of total rewards and earned

### Summary

Full period reward amount and earned will be deducted because of wrong calculation of new `rate` of reward state.

### Root Cause

New rate calculation is wrong.
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L372-L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L372-L374)

It only calculates new rate based on the leftOver amount and  new amount even though duration is not changed.
So the rate will be deducted and because of that, full period reward would be wrong(smaller than the one it should be)

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Notifies the contract about new reward amounts(smaller than already claimed) before previous reward period finished. (`block.timestamp < state.periodFinish`)

### Attack Path

Call `notifyRewardAmount` of `SymmStaking` contract before previous reward period is finished with the new reward amounts(smaller than already claimed).

### Impact

New rate will be deducted and if will make full period reward and earned amount smaller than they should be.


### PoC

Let's assume that original rate was `10`, duration was `168`.
So full period reward `1680`.

If call `notifyRewardAmount` in the middle of previous reward period with smaller amount(420) than already claimed(840), the new rate will be calculated like below.
`remaining` = 84
`leftover` = 84 * 10(origin rate) = 840
`state.rate`(new rate) = (420 + 840) / 168 = 7.5

`new calculated full period reward` = 7.5 * 168 = 1260 (it should be 1680 + 420 = 2100)


### Mitigation

Calculate new rate correctly.
```solidity
uint256 oldTotalAmount = state.rate * state.duration;
state.rate = (amount + oldTotalAmount) / state.duration;
```
