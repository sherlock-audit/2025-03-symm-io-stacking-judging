# Rate got rounded down will make user losing reward token

### Summary
Division before multiplication when calculating the reward rate value will cause users to receive fewer reward tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol:_addRewardsForToken()`, the reward rate calculation performs division before multiplication:

[SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379)

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
	TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];


	if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
>>>		state.rate = amount / state.duration;
	} else {
		uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
		uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
>>>		state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
	}

	...
}
```

This rate is later used in `rewardPerToken()` where it's multiplied by 1e18, but by then precision has already been lost:

[SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202)
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
	...

	return
		rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
>>>		(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
			totalSupply);
}

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. USDC or other low-decimal stablecoin must be used as reward token

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


Let's examine a scenario:
1. There are 1 million $ worth of SYMM staked
2. The staking rate is `9.3%` per year, which means `0.179%` per week
3. The reward token includes USDC with 6 decimals, USDC allocation is 10% of total reward tokens, meaning each week the protocol will add 179$ USDC to the staking contract
4. The rate is calculated as follows: 
```solidity
state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    -> = 179e6 / 1 weeks = 179e6 / 604_800 = 295 (rounded down from 295.96)
```
5. The total amount of USDC received each week is `295 * 604800 ~ 178.4$`, which is 0.6$ short
### Impact

After 17 weeks, users will lose 10$ of their yield due to precision loss.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

+		state.rate = amount * 1e18 / state.duration;
	} else {
