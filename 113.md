# Some users may fail to claim rewards

### Summary

Some users may fail to claim rewards if they are in USDC's blacklist.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking::_claimRewardsFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385-L400), stakers can claim some reward tokens.

 When users claim their rewards, we will loop all reward tokens, and transfer each reward token's reward to the user. The problem is that the reward tokens may include USDC/SYMM, etc. And USDC token has one blacklist.

If one staker is in the USDC's blacklist, when the staker wants to claim rewards, the staker will lose all rewards. Although the staker is added into the USDC's blacklist for some reason, they still have the right to claim other rewards, for example, SYMM reward token. But the stakers will lose all kinds of rewards.

```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

USDC or USDT tokens are added into the reward token.

### External Pre-conditions

The staker is added into the USDC or USDT's blacklist.

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds USDC, SYMM and some other tokens into the reward token list.
2. Alice stakers SYMM into staking contract.
3. After a few reward distribution epoch, Alice earns some rewards, including USDC, SYMM, and some other tokens.
4. Alice is added into USDC's blacklist.
5. Alice wants to claim her rewards, her claim will be reverted.

### Impact

Some users may fail to claim their rewards.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Users can assign the reward token which they want to claim.
