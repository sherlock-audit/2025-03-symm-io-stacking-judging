# Attacker can decrease rewards for stakers via repeated call of `_updateRewardsStates`

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function can be called with non-array, which calls `_updateRewardsStates` function without adding actual rewards. Or attacker can deposit and withdraw dust amount to call `_updateRewardsStates` function.
By repeatedly calling `_updateRewardsStates` function, an attacker can force frequent updates to `state.perTokenStored`. 
Due to rounding errors in `rewardPerToken`, this can lead to a gradual decrease in the rewards for stakers.

### Root Cause

- [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L280) does not revert with non-array, allowing empty reward updates.
- Attacker can deposit and withdraw with dust amount to call `_updateRewardsStates` function.
- Every call updates [`state.perTokenStored`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L199-L201), which is calculated as:  
```solidity
	function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			...
@>			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);
			...
		}
	}

	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
@>			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```
- Since Solidity rounds down in integer division, frequent updates cause **small losses in `perTokenStored`** over time. 

#### The root cause is exactly **rounding error accumulation due to frequent update**.

### Attack Path

1. Normal `notifyRewardAmount` happens:
amount = 30000e6 = 30000$
totalSupply = 10000e18
rate = amount / 1 week = 30000e6 / 604800 = 49,603
perTokenStored = 0
2. Then, malicious user calls notifyRewardAmount function with non-array, 2 seconds(duration of block in base) later:
perTokenStored = 2 * rate * 1e18 / totalSupply = 9.9206 = 9
3. loss of overall reward amount:
totalSupply * (9.9206 - 9) / 1e18 = 9,206 wei of USDC = 0.009206$
the loss of overall reward amount is 0.01$ at max.

### PoC
In every call of `_updateRewardsStates`, the maximum loss of overall fund is approximately `totalSupply / 1e18` wei (usdc).
Considering the price of SYMM is 0.03$(at max), 10000e18 of `totalSupply` is only 300$(not high and can be real supply).
Block time in base is 2 ~ 3s and 1 week is 604800s. This means that attacker can call `_updateRewardsStates` every 2 ~ 3 seconds and the number of call could be 201,600 ~ 302,400.
The accumulation of overall fund could be 2000~3000$.(Assuming maximum loss every time)
Of course, this value is an amount that cannot be achieved in real, but significant loss in overall reward amount happens.
Considering that the worth of reward in above example is 30000$, for HIGH severity, the loss should be higher than 300$(1%).
This condition can be satisfied even with a `totalSupply` of 10000e18 easily, and the larger the `totalSupply`, the greater the loss.

### Impact

rewards loss for stakers

### Mitigation

Introduce mechanism to prevent malicious call of `notifyRewardAmount` and dust deposit and withdraw for update `perTokenStored` frequently.
