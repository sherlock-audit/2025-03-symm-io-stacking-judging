# SYMM/USDC pool imbalance will cause failed penalty avoidance for users as liquidity provision becomes economically unviable

### Summary

Root Cause: In SymmVesting.sol, the addLiquidity function relies on real-time Balancer pool balances to calculate required USDC without adequate slippage protection.
Impact: Users attempting to avoid early unlock penalties via liquidity provision may instead pay excessive USDC or face penalties due to unfavorable pool ratios.

### Root Cause

Code Issue: In [SymmVesting.sol#L247-L256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247-L256), getLiquidityQuote calculates USDC requirements based on current pool balances, which can be manipulated or imbalanced.

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to use instantaneous Balancer pool balances for penalty avoidance is a mistake, as it exposes users to market volatility and pool manipulation.
```solidity
	    function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
	}

	function _mintTokenIfPossible(address token, uint256 amount) internal override {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has locked SYMM tokens eligible for early unlock (with a 50% penalty).

2. Balancer 80/20 SYMM-USDC pool has insufficient USDC liquidity relative to SYMM.

### External Pre-conditions

1. SYMM price drops significantly on external markets, creating an imbalance in the Balancer pool.

2. High volatility causes the SYMM/USDC ratio in the pool to deviate from the expected 80/20 split

### Attack Path

1. User initiates liquidity provision to avoid the 50% penalty:
  solidity
  addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);  
2. Pool imbalance detected:
  solidity
  (uint256 usdcAmount, ) = getLiquidityQuote(amount);  
  // usdcAmount = (SYMM * USDC_balance) / SYMM_balance  
  If SYMM_balance >> USDC_balance, usdcAmount becomes prohibitively high.

3. Transaction reverts if usdcAmount > maxUsdcIn, forcing the user to claim locked tokens with a 50% penalty.

### Impact

1. Users suffer a 50% penalty on their locked SYMM despite attempting to avoid it.

2. Protocol faces loss of trust due to failed penalty avoidance mechanics.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Dynamic Slippage Check: Ensure the value of LP tokens received exceeds the penalty:
    solidity
    uint256 penaltyValue = (amount * SYMM_PRICE * 50) / 100;  
    uint256 lpValue = lpAmount * LP_PRICE;  
    require(lpValue >= penaltyValue, "Slippage too high");  
2. TWAP Oracle: Use time-weighted average prices from Balancer to calculate USDC requirements instead of spot prices.

3. Fallback Mechanism: Allow users to cancel liquidity provision and retain locked SYMM if slippage exceeds thresholds.
