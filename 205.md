# Loss of Accumulated Rewards on Withdrawal

*Vulnerability details*
The contract fails to preserve unclaimed rewards when a user withdraws their entire stake without claiming rewards first. The _updateRewardsStates function updates the reward state based on the user's current stake. However, since the withdraw function sets the user's stake balance to zero before they claim rewards, the rewards calculation results in a loss of accumulated rewards.

[vulnerable function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L250C2-L260C3)
```javascript
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);
        // @audit missing mechanism to claim accumulated reward.
		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
		totalSupply -= amount;
		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}
```

*Impact*
Users can unintentionally lose all their accumulated staking rewards if they withdraw their entire stake before claiming.

*Proof of concept*
##Scenario Demonstrating the Issue

1 Alice stakes tokens:

* Alice stakes 100 tokens in the contract.

* The contract tracks her stake and updates the rewards calculation.

2 Rewards accumulate over time:

* For 6 days, Alice earns rewards based on her stake.

* The `_updateRewardsStates` function updates her accumulated rewards per token.

3 Alice withdraws all her tokens before claiming rewards:

* She calls withdraw(100, aliceAddress), which triggers `_updateRewardsStates`.

* The `_updateRewardsStates` function calculates her rewards based on the current stake balance.

* Since `balanceOf[Alice]` becomes 0 after withdrawal, her `earned()` rewards reset to `0`.

* As a result, she loses all her unclaimed rewards.

*Recommended Mitigation*
To prevent users from losing their rewards, enforce an automatic reward claim before allowing withdrawal. Modify the withdraw function to ensure users claim their pending rewards before their stake balance is set to zero:

```diff
   function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);

    // Automatically claim rewards before withdrawal
+    _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);

    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```
By implementing this fix, users will always receive their rightful rewards before withdrawing their stake, preventing any accidental reward loss.
