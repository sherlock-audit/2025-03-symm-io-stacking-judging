# Unsafe Typecasting of Token Amounts in `PERMIT2.approve` Could Lead to Approval Errors and Fund Loss

### Summary:
The `_addLiquidity` function in the contract approves token amounts to the `PERMIT2` contract using a potentially unsafe typecasting approach from `uint256` to `uint160`. This leads to the risk of overflow/underflow conditions when approving large token amounts, especially if the value exceeds the `uint160` limit. If the user sets an amount higher than `uint160`'s maximum value (2^160 - 1), the resulting approval amount will be much smaller than expected, which may cause the contract to approve incorrect amounts, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, fund loss, or system manipulation.

### Root Cause:
- **Unsafe Downcasting from `uint256` to `uint160`**: In the `PERMIT2.approve` function, the token amount is typecast from `uint256` to `uint160` (due to the function signature). This typecasting can cause **overflow or underflow** if the token amount exceeds the `uint160` limit (2^160 - 1).
- **No Overflow Check**: There is no explicit check to ensure that the token amount does not exceed the `uint160` limit before passing it to the `PERMIT2.approve` function. This can result in smaller-than-expected values being approved for liquidity operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions:
- **Token Amounts**: The function expects the user to specify `symmIn` and `usdcIn`, which are then passed as arguments to the `PERMIT2.approve` function.
- **Approval Call**: The contract calls `PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp))` and `PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp))`, where the `symmIn` and `usdcIn` amounts are cast to `uint160`.

### External Pre-conditions:
- **PERMIT2 Contract**: The contract uses `PERMIT2.approve` for token approvals, which expects a `uint160` amount. If the value passed exceeds the `uint160` limit, it will result in the approval amount being truncated, leading to incorrect approvals.


### Impact:
- **Incorrect Approval Amounts**: If a user attempts to approve a token amount greater than `uint160`'s maximum value (2^160 - 1), the amount will be truncated to a much smaller value. This means the contract will approve an incorrect, smaller amount, which could prevent the liquidity addition from functioning as expected.


### Attack Path:
1. **Overflow/Underflow Exploitation**: An attacker could craft a transaction where the `symmIn` or `usdcIn` amounts exceed the `uint160` limit (2^160 - 1).


### Mitigation:
1. **Validation of Token Amounts**: Add validation to ensure that the token amount does not exceed the maximum value of `uint160` before calling the `PERMIT2.approve` function. If the value exceeds the limit, revert the transaction with an appropriate error message:
   ```solidity
   uint256 maxUint160 = type(uint160).max;
   if (symmIn > maxUint160 || usdcIn > maxUint160) revert AmountExceedsUint160Limit();
   ```
