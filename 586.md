# Missing Functionality to distribute  incentives

### Summary


According to prior documentation, the Symmio protocol was designed such that when a user triggers an early unlock of locked tokens, a 50% penalty is applied—with 80% of the penalty distributed to non‐unlockers and 20% allocated to ecosystem incentives (subject to DAO vote). However, upon reviewing the implementation in the inherited Vesting contract, we find that the entire penalty is transferred to a single address, `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

### Code Analysis

In the `_claimLockedToken` function, the following steps occur:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
```


### Root Cause

### Code Analysis

In the `_claimLockedToken` function, the following steps occur:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Penalty Calculation:**  
   The penalty is computed as:
   `penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;`
   
   For a 50% penalty, `lockedClaimPenalty` would be set to 0.5e18 (i.e. 500000000000000000).

2. **Penalty Transfer:**  
   The entire computed penalty is transferred via:
   
 `  IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);`

   This means that 100% of the penalty amount goes to the single address stored in `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

3. **No Split Logic:**  
   There is no code present that splits the penalty amount between two recipients (e.g., 80% to non-unlockers and 20% to ecosystem incentives). The design does not include any further logic or additional parameters to handle a split distribution.

### Attack Path

### Proof of Mismatch

- **Documentation vs. Implementation:**  
  - **Documentation Claim:** The protocol’s earlier documentation stated that early unlock penalties would be split with an 80/20 distribution.
  - **Code Implementation:** The observed code transfers the full penalty to one address. There is no mechanism (no additional addresses, no arithmetic split) that implements an 80/20 division.

- **Implication:**  
  As a result, users who opt for early unlocks will have the full penalty amount routed to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`, contradicting the intended split described in the documentation.


### Impact



### Impact and Potential Risks

- **Economic Incentives Misalignment:**  
  If the intended design was to reward non‐unlockers (80% share) and allocate a portion to ecosystem incentives (20% share), the current implementation fails to do so. This misallocation might:
  - Disincentivize non‐unlockers from benefiting as expected.
  - Misalign ecosystem incentive distributions, potentially affecting community trust and tokenomics.
  
- **DAO Governance Expectations:**  
  Stakeholders expecting DAO-controlled redistribution for the ecosystem portion will find that the entire penalty bypasses such a mechanism.

- **Protocol Discrepancy:**  
  This discrepancy between design documentation and actual code implementation represents a critical deviation that should be rectified to align with the protocol’s intended economic model.

        uint256 penaltyReceiverBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(penaltyReceiver);

        console.log("User received:", userBalance / 1e18, "SYMM");
        console.log("Penalty receiver received:", penaltyReceiverBalance / 1e18, "SYMM");

        // Assert full penalty went to receiver
        assertEq(penaltyReceiverBalance, 100_000 * 1e18, "Penalty not fully transferred to receiver");
        // No redistribution occurs (manual check for ecosystem/non-unlockers would show 0)
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

### Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Implement Split Distribution Logic:**  
   Modify the penalty distribution mechanism to split the penalty amount according to the intended 80/20 ratio. For example:
   ```solidity
   uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
   uint256 penaltyNonUnlockers = (penalty * 80) / 100;
   uint256 penaltyEcosystem = penalty - penaltyNonUnlockers; // implicitly 20%

   // Transfer penalty portions to the respective addresses.
   IERC20(token).transfer(nonUnlockersRewardReceiver, penaltyNonUnlockers);
   IERC20(token).transfer(ecosystemIncentivesReceiver, penaltyEcosystem);
   ```
   This change would require introducing an additional state variable (e.g., `nonUnlockersRewardReceiver` or similar) to capture the 80% recipient, while repurposing the existing `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` for one of the two splits—or renaming both appropriately.
