# Permanent Reward Token Lockup Through Malicious Reward Period Extension Attack

### Summary

The `SymmStaking` contract has a critical vulnerability in its reward distribution mechanism. The notifyRewardAmount function lacks access control and interacts with [`_addRewardsForToken,`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378) which always extends the reward period. An attacker can exploit this to permanently trap reward tokens in the contract by repeatedly adding minimal amounts of rewards, preventing full distribution of legitimate rewards and effectively locking protocol funds.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from two core issues:
1- The `notifyRewardAmount` function can be called by any user without access control:
```javascript
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // No access control check
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    // ...
}
```
2- The `_addRewardsForToken` function unconditionally extends the reward period with each call

```javascript
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; // Always extends by full duration
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

We have a 1000 token rate

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker add miniscule rewards after each day to extend the reward period 

### Attack Path

1. The protocol initializes the contract with legitimate rewards (e.g., 7,000 tokens with a rate of 1,000 tokens per day)
2. Day 1: The attacker begins their daily attack sequence:

- Adds minimal reward amount (0.001 token)
- This recalculates the rate: (6,000 + 0.001) / 7 = 857.143 tokens per day
- Period extends by 7 days


3. Day 2: Attacker repeats with another 0.001 token addition:

- Remaining rewards: 857.143 × 6 = 5,142.858 tokens
- New rate: (5,142.858 + 0.001) / 7 = 734.694 tokens per day
- Period extends again to day 9


4. Day 3: The pattern continues:

- Remaining rewards: 734.694 × 6 = 4,408.164 tokens
- New rate: (4,408.164 + 0.001) / 7 = 629.738 tokens per day
- Period extends to day 10


5. The attacker continues this pattern daily, causing:

- Exponential decay of the reward rate
- Continuous extension of the distribution period
- Effective lockup of the vast majority of tokens

### Impact

After just 30 days of daily attacks with 0.001 token additions, the reward rate decays to approximately 0.1% of the original rate (1,000 → 1.03 tokens per day), the mathematical decay pattern ensures that a significant portion of rewards will never be distributed within any reasonable timeframe. For a protocol with substantial reward allocations, this represents direct financial loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

either Add access control to notifyRewardAmount or fix the periodFinish Extension
