# `whenNotPaused` Modifier in `notifyRewardAmount()` prevents reward accumulation

## Summary: 

When the contract `SymmStaking` is in a pausable state, it prevents any deposits / withdrawals. 
However, any attempts to add rewards via `notifyRewardAmount()`are also halted, even though the contract still accumulates rewards for existing user. 



## Description: 

The `whenNotPaused` modifier prevents certain functions from executing when the contract is paused. 

However, the `notifyRewardAmount()` function, which is responsible for notifying the system about new reward tokens, also uses `whenNotPaused`.
[#notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L278)

This is problematic because **even though deposits are halted, the contract still needs to continue receiving rewards**, updating its reward distribution, and making reward claims.

The pause mechanism effectively blocks reward accumulation, halting the flow of rewards into the contract and stopping accrual of rewards for users.


## Impact: 

- Rewards won't accumlate for stakers.
- Users who are still staked in the contract or have existing balances will not accrue rewards because the reward rate is not updated and new rewards cannot be added.


## Recommendation: 

Consider removing the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the `notifyRewardAmount()` function. 
The idea is that while the contract may be paused to prevent new deposits or withdrawal, reward notifications should still be processed to ensure ongoing reward accumulation. 
The contract should allow rewards to be added to the system regardless of the pause state.
