# Missing Access Control Allows Reward Period Extension Attack. An attacker will dilute rewards for stakers

### Summary

The lack of access control in `notifyRewardAmount()` in `SymmStaking.sol` will cause a dilution of rewards for stakers as an attacker will repeatedly extend the reward period with minimal token amounts.


### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol within the notifyRewardAmount function, there is no access control check to restrict who can call it. This allows anyone to invoke the function and extend the reward distribution period by calling _addRewardsForToken, which resets periodFinish to block.timestamp + duration with even a minimal reward amount (e.g., 1 wei).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract must have at least one whitelisted reward token (Admin needs to call configureRewardToken to set isRewardToken[rewardToken1] to be exactly true).

2. Any user, including an attacker, must be able to call notifyRewardAmount (User1 needs to call deposit to set balanceOf[user1] to be at least 500 * 10**18).

3. Admin needs to call notifyRewardAmount to set pendingRewards[rewardToken1] to be at least 100 * 10**18 (The reward duration is extended every time notifyRewardAmount is called with a nonzero amount).




### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have a minimal amount of the reward token to call notifyRewardAmount repeatedly.

2. Gas fees must be low enough for repeated calls to be economically viable.

### Attack Path

1. User1 calls deposit to stake 500 tokens, expecting to earn rewards from the adminâ€™s initial notification of 100 tokens over 1 week.

2. Admin calls notifyRewardAmount with tokens = [rewardToken1] and amounts = [100 * 10**18], setting the reward period to end in 1 week (WEEK).

3. Attacker calls notifyRewardAmount with tokens = [rewardToken1] and amounts = [1 wei] repeatedly (e.g., every few hours or daily), each call extending periodFinish by 1 week from the current block.timestamp.

4. User1 attempts to claim rewards at the original periodFinish, but the reward rate is diluted due to the extended period, and the full 100 tokens are not yet distributed.




### Impact

1. Stakers suffer from indefinitely delayed or diluted rewards.
2. Delayed Reward Distribution: Legitimate stakers may never reach the originally planned claim period for their rewards, causing frustration and potentially reducing user engagement and trust in the protocol.
3. Attacker Advantage: The attacker can exploit the mechanism without significant cost, while the stakers bear the brunt of reduced and delayed rewards. Over time, this could drive users away, harming the protocol's overall value and market reputation.

### Mitigation

1. Implement Access Control: Restrict notifyRewardAmount to be callable only by authorized roles (e.g., onlyOwner or onlyAdmin).

2. Add a Minimum Reward Threshold: Ensure that a significant minimum reward amount is required to trigger the function.

3. Prevent Repeated Small Additions: Enforce a cooldown period between consecutive calls to notifyRewardAmount.

4. Cap Reward Period Extensions: Set a maximum extension limit to prevent indefinite extensions.

By implementing these mitigations, the staking mechanism can maintain fair reward distribution and prevent manipulation by malicious actors.



// Example mitigation
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)
{
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

    uint256 len = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        if (amount < 1 * 10**18) revert("Amount too small"); // Minimum 1 token
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
