# Donating small amount of reward tokens will infliate reward for other users

### Summary

In SymmStaking.sol anyone can donate reward to the pool of reward token via notifyRewardAmount().
Meanwhile it will increase not only reward amount and reset the time of reward distribution as well, in certain  cases it might be used by attacker to grief reward distribution for other users. 

The problem occurs because _addRewardsForToken() resetting duration each time someone add reward
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
Consider the following example
We had usdt as a reward token, and wanted to distribute 10 000 usdt as a reward within 100 days - it is 100 usdt/day
After 60 day passed the grifier decided to add 1 usdt in reward pool
For now duration of the distribution resetted and 1 usdt was added to pool. So rewards now will 4001 usdt / 100 day which is 40.01 usdt / day

As you can see reward amount not affected, but the duration resets each time which lead to infliation of reward over time

### Root Cause

SymmStaking.sol
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; 
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Attack Path

Consider the following example
We had usdt as a reward token, and wanted to distribute 10 000 usdt as a reward within 100 days - it is 100 usdt/day
After 60 day passed the grifier decided to add 1 usdt in reward pool
For now duration of the distribution resetted and 1 usdt was added to pool. So rewards now will 4001 usdt / 100 day which is 40.01 usdt / day

### Impact

infliation of reward - users will make lower reward each block than it supposed to be

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

do not reset duration after adding reward
