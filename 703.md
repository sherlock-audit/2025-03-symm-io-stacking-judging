# Front-Running Liquidity Addition Exploits Users for Attacker Profit

### Summary

The lack of protection against pool manipulation in addLiquidity will cause financial losses for liquidity providers as an attacker will front-run their transactions to skew the SYMM/USDC pool ratio, resulting in fewer LP tokens or transaction failures.



### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol:149-197, the _addLiquidity function fetches a quote via getLiquidityQuote and submits it to ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional without validating the pool’s state against an external reference, allowing an attacker to manipulate symmBalance or usdcBalance before the liquidity addition is finalized.



### Internal Pre-conditions

Users need to call addLiquidity or addLiquidityByPercentage to set symmAmount to be at least 1 SYMM token to initiate liquidity addition.

The POOL contract needs to have non-zero symmBalance and usdcBalance to allow getLiquidityQuote to return a valid quote.

The minLpAmount parameter needs to be set to a non-zero value (or rely on the default 1% slippage tolerance) to enforce slippage checks that can be exploited.



### External Pre-conditions

The SYMM/USDC pool (via POOL) needs to be manipulable (e.g., low liquidity or no anti-manipulation measures) to allow the attacker to alter symmBalance or usdcBalance within a single block.

The Ethereum mempool needs to be accessible to the attacker, enabling them to observe and front-run pending addLiquidity transactions.



### Attack Path

User calls addLiquidity(1000e18, 990, 0) to add 1000 SYMM to the SYMM/USDC pool, expecting ~1000 LP tokens with a 1% slippage tolerance (minLpAmount = 990).

Attacker monitors the mempool and detects the pending transaction, noting the symmAmount = 1000e18 and lack of maxUsdcIn cap.

Attacker front-runs by executing a large swap in the pool (e.g., swaps 500 USDC for SYMM, shifting balances from 8000 SYMM / 2000 USDC to 8200 SYMM / 1500 USDC), skewing the ratio.

The getLiquidityQuote function calculates usdcAmount = (1000e18 * 1500e6) / 8200e18 ≈ 182.93e6 USDC, lower than the original ~250e6 USDC expected, and expectedLpAmount drops due to the altered pool state.

The ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional call returns fewer LP tokens (e.g., 975 instead of ~1000), either passing the slippage check (975 > 990 fails, reverting) or succeeding with suboptimal yield, while the attacker profits from arbitrage by reversing the swap.



### Impact

The liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss of up to 2-5% of their expected LP tokens (e.g., 25 LP tokens worth ~25 SYMM in value), depending on pool liquidity and manipulation extent. The attacker gains this value through arbitrage profits, exploiting the price shift.
