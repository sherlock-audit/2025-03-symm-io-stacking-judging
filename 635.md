# Excess SYMM Token Usage in Liquidity Addition Due to Missing Unlocked Token Claim

### Summary

In the addLiquidityByPercentage function, the absence of a call to _claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender) before calculating the token amount may result in more SYMM tokens being added to Balancer than the user intended. This occurs because the function does not first clear any unlocked tokens, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the locked token balance available for liquidity.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L120

The function fails to claim any unlocked SYMM tokens prior to computing the amount of locked tokens to use. Without calling _claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender), the system mistakenly includes unlocked tokens in the available balance for liquidity addition, which can lead to an excessive amount of SYMM being contributed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The vesting plan for SYMM holds unlocked tokens that have not yet been claimed.

The liquidity addition process computes the available locked amount based on the total locked tokens without adjusting for any pending unlocked tokens.


### External Pre-conditions

A user invokes addLiquidityByPercentage expecting only a specific percentage of their locked SYMM tokens to be used for liquidity addition.



### Attack Path

 user calls addLiquidityByPercentage with a specific percentage, intending to contribute only that fraction of their locked SYMM tokens.

The function does not call _claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender), leaving unlocked tokens unclaimed in the vesting plan.

The calculation for the liquidity addition amount inadvertently includes the unlocked tokens, resulting in a higher SYMM token amount being used.

This leads to an excessive liquidity addition on Balancer beyond the user's intended limit.

### Impact

Users may unknowingly contribute more SYMM tokens than planned

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a call to `_claimUnlockedToken(SYMM, msg.sender)` at the beginning of addLiquidityByPercentage to ensure all unlocked tokens are claimed before performing liquidity calculations.
