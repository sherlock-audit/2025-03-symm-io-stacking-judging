# Missing Setter Functions to Update `Vesting::lockedClaimPenalty` and `Vesting::lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`

### Summary

The `Vesting `contract lacks functionality to update `lockedClaimPenalty` and `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` parameters after initialization, forcing contract upgrades for any changes to these critical parameters.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L61-L62

In `Vesting`, both `Vesting::lockedClaimPenalty` and `Vesting::lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` are set during initialization, but no functions are implemented to update these values afterward, despite documentation suggesting these aspects should be adjustable through governance.

```text
Early Unlock Option: Users can unlock vested tokens early with a 50% penaltyâ€”half is received, and half is redistributed (80% to non-unlockers, 20% to ecosystem incentives, subject to DAO vote).
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `lockedClaimPenalty` and `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` are stored as state variables in the Vesting contract
2. These values are set during initialization and cannot be modified afterward
3. Neither the base `Vesting` contract nor the inheriting `SymmVesting` contract provide functions to update these parameters

### External Pre-conditions

None specific required.



### Attack Path

This is a design limitation rather than an attack vector.

### Impact

1. If the penalty recipient address becomes compromised, there's no way to update it without a contract upgrade
2. If economic conditions change and the DAO wants to adjust the penalty rate, no mechanism exists to implement this change
3. Any parameter changes require a full contract upgrade, which increases risk and operational complexity

### PoC

No PoC needed except visual. 

```solidity
// From the Vesting contract:
// State variables with no setter functions
uint256 public lockedClaimPenalty;
address public lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver;

// Initialization function that sets these values
function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public initializer {
    lockedClaimPenalty = _lockedClaimPenalty;
    lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver = _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver;
    // ...rest of initialization
}

// No functions exist in either Vesting or SymmVesting to update these parameters after initialization
```

### Mitigation

Implement setter functions with appropriate access controls either by creating a `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or using `SETTER_ROLE`:

```solidity
// Add setter for penalty rate
function setLockedClaimPenalty(uint256 _newPenaltyRate) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    require(_newPenaltyRate <= 1e18, "Penalty rate cannot exceed 100%");
    uint256 oldPenalty = lockedClaimPenalty;
    lockedClaimPenalty = _newPenaltyRate;
    emit PenaltyRateUpdated(oldPenalty, _newPenaltyRate);
}

// Add setter for penalty receiver
function setLockedClaimPenaltyReceiver(address _newReceiver) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    require(_newReceiver != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
    address oldReceiver = lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver;
    lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver = _newReceiver;
    emit PenaltyReceiverUpdated(oldReceiver, _newReceiver);
}

// Define events for transparency
event PenaltyRateUpdated(uint256 oldRate, uint256 newRate);
event PenaltyReceiverUpdated(address oldReceiver, address newReceiver);
```
