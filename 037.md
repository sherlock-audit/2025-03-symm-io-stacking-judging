# [M-08] Multiple Token Transfers Without Validation in Claim Locked Tokens

## Summary

In the `_claimLockedToken` function of the Vesting contract, two consecutive token transfers are performed without validation between them, which could lead to partial execution if the first transfer succeeds but the second fails.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Vesting.sol:295-296, the `_claimLockedToken` function performs two consecutive token transfers without any validation between them:

Code reference: Vesting.sol#L295-L296 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L295-L296

```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

The issue is that these transfers are made without checking the return value of either transfer or using SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()`. If the first transfer succeeds but the second fails, the function will have executed partially, leading to an inconsistent state. This is especially problematic because:

1. The penalty amount would remain in the contract instead of being transferred to the penalty receiver
2. The function would have updated the vesting plan state and emitted an event suggesting both transfers were successful

While this issue is related to the use of raw `transfer()` calls reported in issue #49, it represents a distinct vulnerability: even if SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()` is used, the problem of partial execution would remain unless additional validation is added between the transfers.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

1. **Partial State Updates**: If only the first transfer succeeds, the contract's state would be updated as if both transfers succeeded, creating accounting discrepancies.

2. **Loss of Penalty Funds**: The penalty amount would remain in the contract instead of being sent to the designated penalty receiver, potentially causing the protocol to lose revenue.

3. **Inconsistent Event Emissions**: The contract would emit an event indicating that both the user payment and penalty were processed correctly, even though only one transfer succeeded.

4. **Contract-Level State Inconsistency**: The contract's internal accounting would be incorrect if penalties are tracked or accumulated.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Vesting.sol:295-296
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are several approaches to address this issue:

1. **Use a try-catch structure** to handle potential failures in either transfer:

```solidity
bool success1 = IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
if (!success1) revert TransferFailed();
bool success2 = IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
if (!success2) {
    // Handle the failure of the second transfer
    // This could involve reverting the entire transaction or implementing
    // a recovery mechanism for the penalty amount
    revert PenaltyTransferFailed();
}
```

2. **Combine the transfers** into a single operation if possible, such as by using a batch transfer function or a separate escrow mechanism for penalties.

3. **Implement a locking mechanism** for penalties that allows for recovery in case of transfer failures:

```solidity
// First, update the state
pendingPenalties[lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver] += penalty;

// Then, perform the user transfer
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);

// Finally, attempt to transfer the penalty
try IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty) {
    // Successfully transferred, clear pending amount
    pendingPenalties[lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver] -= penalty;
} catch {
    // Transfer failed, keep track of pending amount for later recovery
    emit PenaltyTransferFailed(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
}
```

By implementing one of these recommendations, the contract can ensure that either both transfers succeed or appropriate recovery mechanisms are in place for partial execution.
