# Unclaimed Pending Rewards Preventing Reward Token Removal

### Summary

The `configureRewardToken` function allows adding and removing tokens from the `rewardTokens` array and updates the `isRewardToken` mapping. However, the function enforces a constraint that prevents removing a token from the reward list if `pendingRewards[token] > 10`. Since `pending rewards decrease only when users claim them`, this check `relies on user action`, making the removal process vulnerable to manipulation. Malicious actors or inactive users can **intentionally leave small amounts of staking tokens which is just enough to accrue 10 unit of the token reward, and then leave the reward unclaimed for an extended period, preventing the removal of a reward token indefinitely**.

### Root Cause

1. **Strict Constraint on Reward Token Removal:**
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320
- The check above ensures that a token **cannot be removed if users still have pending rewards greater than 10**.
- Since `pendingRewards[token]` decreases **only when users claim**, any user can **refuse to claim rewards indefinitely**, effectively locking the token in the reward list.

2. **Potential for Malicious Exploitation:**

- Since, their is no check for minimum deposit An attacker can **deposit a small amount** and intentionally **leave their earned rewards unclaimed** so that `pendingRewards[token]` stays above 10.
- As a result, the **token remains in the `rewardTokens` array**, leading to an **ever-growing array size**, increasing gas costs for `_updateRewardsStates`, which is called in **every external function**.
- Since **multiple reward tokens are used**, failing to remove an unwanted token can lead to significant inefficiencies. such as the **protocol unable to freely add new reward token due to the fair of the array growth.**

### Impact

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) on Reward Token Removal**

    - If **no one claims their pending rewards**, the contract **will never be able to remove the token**, leading to an **overgrown array**.
    - Over time, this **increases gas costs in `_updateRewardsStates`**, affecting overall contract efficiency.

2. **Constraint on reward distribution and addition**
   - according to the docs
   `All restricted roles are trusted. For example, in the staking contract, the number of reward tokens will not exceed 10â€“20.`
   - In the quest of trying to prevent the overgrowth. Protocol cannot continue to reset the rewards list token freely as it should be. e.g if a their is a new reward token such as USDC. but the token list is already above 20, and the attacker has above 10 unit of each rewards token. Then USDC cannot be added as one of the unwanted token cant be removed.

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Implement a Forced Claim Mechanism**
Allow the contract to forcefully distribute pending rewards when removing a reward token
