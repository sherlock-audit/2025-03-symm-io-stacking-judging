# Improper Use of `initializer` Modifier in `SymmVesting`

### Summary

The `SymmVesting` contract inherits from `Vesting` and has an `initialize` function that uses the `initializer` modifier. Since `SymmVesting` is an extension of `Vesting`, and `Vesting` already has an initializer function (`__vesting_init`), the `SymmVesting` contract should use the `onlyInitializing` modifier instead of `initializer`.


### Root Cause

The [initialize](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L55) function in [SymmVesting](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol) is marked with the `initializer` modifier. However, since `SymmVesting` extends [Vesting](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol), which already has an `initializer` function, the `SymmVesting` contract should use the `onlyInitializing` modifier to ensure that all inherited contracts can complete their initialization process.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

 N/A

### Attack Path

- Deploying `SymmVesting` with another inheriting contract may lead to a failed initialization, making the contract unusable.
- The contract may be deployed with missing initializations, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Impact

This issue does not pose an immediate security risk, but it prevents proper initialization of `SymmVesting` when deployed. If a child contract inherits from `SymmVesting` and attempts to initialize, the `initializer` modifier would prevent the base contract (`Vesting`) from being initialized again, potentially causing the contract to be deployed in a non-functional state.

### PoC

```solidity
contract MySymmVesting is SymmVesting {
    function initializeExtended(address admin, address receiver) public initializer {
        initialize(admin, receiver, ...);
    }
}
```

- Deploying `MySymmVesting` and calling `initializeExtended` will fail because `initializer` in `SymmVesting` prevents multiple initializations in the inheritance chain.

### Mitigation

Replace `initializer` with `onlyInitializing` in `SymmVesting`'s `initialize` function to allow inherited contracts to initialize correctly.

```solidity
function initialize(
    address admin,
    address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver,
    address _pool,
    address _router,
    address _permit2,
    address _vault,
    address _symm,
    address _usdc,
    address _symm_lp
) public onlyInitializing {
    if (
        admin == address(0) ||
        _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver == address(0) ||
        _pool == address(0) ||
        _router == address(0) ||
        _permit2 == address(0) ||
        _vault == address(0) ||
        _symm == address(0) ||
        _usdc == address(0) ||
        _symm_lp == address(0)
    ) revert ZeroAddress();
    
    __vesting_init(admin, 500000000000000000, _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver);
    
    POOL = IPool(_pool);
    ROUTER = IRouter(_router);
    PERMIT2 = IPermit2(_permit2);
    VAULT = _vault;
    SYMM = _symm;
    USDC = _usdc;
    SYMM_LP = _symm_lp;
}
```

This ensures that the `SymmVesting` contract can be initialized without interfering with the initialization of its parent (`Vesting`) or any future inheriting contracts.
