# Vesting Plan Misconfiguration for vested users

### Summary

The missing check in _setupVestingPlans will cause an unwanted reconfiguration of existing vesting positions for users, as previously vested positions can be overwritten. This will result in inflated totals for totalVested[token] (by counting amounts multiple times) and reset vesting timings, causing users to wait longer for their tokens to vest.

### Root Cause

In setupVestingPlans (and the underlying _setupVestingPlans function), there is no validation to check if a user already has an existing vesting position for the given token. Specifically, the code:

```solidity

VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
vestingPlan.setup(amount, startTime, endTime);

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

user should have previously setted up vesting position.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. setupVestingPlans is called with arrays of users and amounts, even if some users already have existing vesting positions.

2.For each user in the list, the function adds the new vesting amount to totalVested[token] and calls vestingPlan.setup(amount, startTime, endTime) without checking for a pre-existing vesting plan.

3.Existing vesting plans get overwritten, which resets the vesting period and incorrectly aggregates the vested amount, causing users to wait longer or receive an incorrect token claim amount.


### Impact

User Frustration and Griefing:

Users may end up waiting an extended period for token vesting because their vesting schedules are reset.

Incorrect Accounting:

The total token amount recorded in totalVested[token] becomes inflated as if users has previous positions then amount is already added, potentially affecting any calculations or logic that depend on accurate vesting totals.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement valid checks to determine that the position that is being created in new , and not over writes the previous one , a way of doing that can be same as how _resetVestingPlans does 

```solidity

VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];

uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();

if(oldTotal > 0) revert position_already_vested():


```
