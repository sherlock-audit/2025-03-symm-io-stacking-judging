# Lack of Approval Restrictions: Potential for Vault Fund Misuse via Router

### Summary
The contract’s liquidity addition function includes a comment stating that it “approves token spending for the VAULT,” yet in practice the code only approves token spending for `PERMIT2` and the `ROUTER`. The `VAULT` address, although set during initialization, is never used in the liquidity flow. This discrepancy can lead to confusion and potential misconfiguration if the intended design was to have the vault involved in liquidity operations.

### Vulnerability Details
**Code Comment vs. Implementation**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L183

The inline comment in the `_addLiquidity` function claims that `USDC` is transferred from the user and then approved for the `VAULT`. However, the subsequent lines approve tokens for the `PERMIT2`` contract and then call `PERMIT2.approve` with the `ROUTER` as the spender:

```solidity
usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```
**Intended Role of the Vault**:
The VAULT address is set during initialization but is never referenced during liquidity provisioning. It appears the vault was meant to act as a secure intermediary for token management. By bypassing the vault, the contract loses an important layer of control and isolation intended to safeguard user funds.

### Impact
The misconfiguration exposes user funds to significant risk:

1. **Direct Exposure to Router Vulnerabilities**:
Since the tokens are approved directly for the ROUTER via PERMIT2 rather than being mediated through a secure vault, any vulnerability or compromise in the ROUTER can lead to an attacker directly transferring tokens from the contract.
2. **Loss of Protective Isolation**:
The vault was likely designed to enforce additional access controls, auditing, or even rate limiting to prevent abuse. Without its involvement, funds intended for liquidity or vesting can be drained in a single exploit, leading to immediate and irreversible loss of user assets.
### Mitigation
1. **Correct Documentation and Code Alignment**:
Update the inline comments to accurately reflect the implemented approval flow.
If the vault was intended to mediate token approvals, modify the code to direct approvals to the vault and then let the vault interact with `PERMIT2` and the `ROUTER`.

2. **Reassess the Approval Flow**:
Ensure that token approvals are granted only after proper isolation of user funds.
Consider implementing a dedicated vault module for handling liquidity operations, which encapsulates access control and minimizes direct exposure of tokens to the router.
