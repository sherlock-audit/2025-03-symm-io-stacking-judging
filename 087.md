# Insufficient Reward Amount Notification Causes Zero Reward Rate Calculation

 In the [_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) function, the reward rate is computed using integer division as shown below:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```

When the notified reward `amount` (plus any calculated `leftover`) is less than `state.duration`, the integer division truncates the result to zero, thereby setting `state.rate` to zero. This directly prevents any rewards from accruing for stakers even though tokens have been deposited and recorded in `pendingRewards`. It directly results in stakers receiving no rewards during the reward period because the reward accrual rate is zero.

#### Root Cause
 The use of integer division in calculating `state.rate` without validating that the sum of the new reward amount and any leftover rewards is sufficient to produce a non-zero rate is the primary cause of this bug.

#### Impact
 The primary impact is that stakers will never accumulate rewards during the affected period, effectively locking the deposited reward tokens in the contract and denying users their intended reward payouts.

#### Mitigation
Validate and enforce that the notified reward amount (plus leftover) is sufficiently large to yield a non-zero reward rate, or adjust the calculation using appropriate scaling to prevent the zero-rate scenario.
