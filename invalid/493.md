# Griefing Attack via _addRewardsForToken Allows Reward Period Extension Abuse

### Summary

This issue falls under the **Griefing** category, as it allows an attacker to manipulate the staking reward distribution by indefinitely extending the reward period.

The `_addRewardsForToken` function in the `SymmStaking` contract allows an attacker to indefinitely extend the reward period by repeatedly calling it with minimal reward amounts. This exploit continuously updates `periodFinish`, delaying legitimate stakers' rewards and disrupting the staking mechanism.


### Root Cause

The issue arises from Lines 378-379 in `SymmStaking.sol`, where periodFinish is updated every time `_addRewardsForToken` is called:

```solidity
state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; // L379
```
Since there is no restriction preventing updates when `periodFinish` is still in effect, an attacker can repeatedly call `_addRewardsForToken` with small amounts, delaying rewards distribution indefinitely.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `_addRewardsForToken` function is called internally to update staking rewards.
2  The contract does not prevent an active reward period from being extended.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker has the ability to trigger `_addRewardsForToken` (via `notifyRewardAmount`).
2. The function does not check if the current reward period is still active before updating `periodFinish`.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount(1)` → this invokes `_addRewardsForToken(token, 1)`.
2. `state.periodFinish` is **reset** to `block.timestamp + state.duration`.
3. The attacker repeats the call before the reward period expires.
4. **Result:** The staking period is indefinitely extended, and rewards are delayed for legitimate users.


### Impact

1. **Legitimate stakers’ rewards are indefinitely delayed.**
2. **The staking mechanism is disrupted**, leading to economic inefficiencies.
3. **Potential griefing attack,** where an attacker prevents fair reward distribution.


### PoC

```solidity
// Assume attacker can call notifyRewardAmount() to invoke _addRewardsForToken()
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    symmStaking.notifyRewardAmount(1); // Extends periodFinish each time
}
```
After execution, `periodFinish` never expires, delaying staking rewards indefinitely.

### Mitigation

Introduce a requirement to prevent extending an active period before updating `periodFinish:`
```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish, "Reward period is still active");
```
