# Early Unlock Penalty Distribution Mismatch

### Summary

VESTING  ReadMe.md states that the 50% early unlock penalty should be distributed with 80% to non-unlockers and 20% to ecosystem incentives. However, the contract implementation sends 100% of the penalty to a single `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` address

### Root Cause

```solidity
// In _claimLockedToken
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### Impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Implement the described 80/20 split mechanism or update the documentation to match the implemented behavior.
