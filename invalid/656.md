# Issue M-1: Precision Loss in Liquidity Quote Calculation

### Summary

The getLiquidityQuote function calculates usdcAmount and lpAmount using integer division (/ symmBalance), which can lead to precision loss, especially for small amounts or imbalanced pools. This results in inaccurate USDC requirements or LP token estimates, potentially causing users to overpay USDC or receive fewer LP tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

Root Cause
The getLiquidityQuote function calculates usdcAmount and lpAmount using integer division, which truncates any fractional amounts. This precision loss is particularly problematic for small amounts or imbalanced pools, where even minor truncation can lead to significant discrepancies in the calculated values.

```solidity

function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
    uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
    uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
    uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

    usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
    usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
    lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Pool balances: symmBalance = 1,000,000, usdcBalance = 250,000, totalSupply = 500,000.

2. User calls addLiquidity(101, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn).

3. usdcAmount = (101 * 250,000) / 1,000,000 = 25.25, truncated to 25 by integer division (adjusted by _mulDivUp to 26).

4. lpAmount = (101 * 500,000) / 1,000,000 = 50.5, truncated to 50.

5. User provides 101 SYMM and 26 USDC, but receives only 50 LP tokens instead of 50.5, losing value due to truncation.

6. Over many transactions, this accumulates, leaving value stuck in the pool or unfairly reducing user LP allocations.

### Impact

Minor loss of LP tokens for users, potential pool imbalance, and reduced trust in the liquidity mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increase Precision: Apply _mulDivUp to both usdcAmount and lpAmount calculations:

```solidity

function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
    uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
    uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
    uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];
    usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(symmAmount, usdcBalance, symmBalance);
    lpAmount = _mulDivUp(symmAmount, totalSupply, symmBalance);
}
```
