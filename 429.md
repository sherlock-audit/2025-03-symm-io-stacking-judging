# Malicious Attacker Can Drain tokens via Reentrancy in the `Withdraw()` Function in the SymmStaking.sol contract

### Summary

The `withdraw()` function is designed to allow users to withdraw their staked tokens safely. However, instead of updating the user's balance and the contractâ€™s total supply before transferring tokens, it performs an external token transfer first. This ordering creates a window for reentrancy despite the function using nonReentrant modifier: a malicious user or attacker can reenter the `withdraw()` function and drain funds before the state is properly updated.

### Root Cause

In the `withdraw()` function, the is a  critical issue  is the violation of the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Specifically:

Token Transfer Before State Update, as we can see :

The function calls `IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);` before reducing `totalSupply` and `balanceOf[msg.sender]` in the function below. This premature external call opens the door for a reentrancy attack.

```solidity

	function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender); 

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount(); 
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
	@>	totalSupply -= amount;
	@>	balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; ?
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}
```


A malicious recipient contract, when receiving tokens, can trigger its fallback function to reenter `withdraw()` before the internal state (i.e., the user's balance and total supply) has been updated. Although the function uses a nonReentrant modifier, if reentrancy occurs through interconnected functions (cross-function reentrancy), it can still be exploited.

### Impact


An attacker can repeatedly trigger withdrawals, bypassing the intended balance checks, and extract more tokens than they legitimately own from the contract.

### PoC

Deployment of Malicious Contract:
An attacker deploys a contract specifically designed to serve as the recipient of withdrawn tokens.

Initiating the Withdrawal:
The attacker calls the `withdraw()` function on the vulnerable contract, specifying the malicious contract's address as the recipient.

Triggering the External Call:
During the execution of `withdraw()`, the contract calls `IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount)`; to transfer tokens. Because the malicious recipient is a contract, its fallback function is invoked upon receiving the tokens.

Reentrant Call:
The fallback function in the malicious contract immediately calls `withdraw()` again before the original function call updates the internal state (i.e., before `totalSupply` and `balanceOf[msg.sender]` are reduced).

Draining Funds:
The reentrant call processes with the state still reflecting the pre-withdrawal balance, allowing the attacker to withdraw tokens repeatedly. This cycle continues until the contract's funds are drained.

### Mitigation

Update internal state variables before performing the external token transfer.
```diff
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender); 

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount(); 
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
+               totalSupply -= amount;
+               balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; 
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
-	        totalSupply -= amount;
-		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; 
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}
