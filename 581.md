# Trapped Rewards When Removing Reward Tokens


## Description
The `configureRewardToken` function allows administrators to toggle reward tokens on or off the whitelist. However, there's a critical flaw when removing tokens that have a small remaining `pendingRewards` balance (10 or less), as these rewards become permanently locked and inaccessible.

## Vulnerability Details
The implementation checks if `pendingRewards[token] > 10` and reverts in that case. However, it fails to properly handle scenarios where `pendingRewards[token]` is non-zero but less than or equal to 10. In these cases, the token can be removed from the whitelist while still having pending rewards, creating a state where these remaining rewards cannot be distributed or recovered.

## Impact
This vulnerability results in direct financial loss for users who were entitled to receive these pending rewards. Beyond the immediate financial impact, it undermines trust in the protocol, as locked funds signal reliability issues with the contract design.

## Proof of Concept
1. A reward token `TKN` is whitelisted with `pendingRewards[TKN] = 5`
2. Administrator calls `configureRewardToken` with `status = false`
3. `TKN` is successfully removed from the `rewardTokens` list
4. The 5 tokens in `pendingRewards[TKN]` remain in the contract but become permanently inaccessible

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Modify the function to require `pendingRewards[token] == 0` before allowing token removal
- Alternatively, implement a mechanism to distribute any remaining rewards before a token is removed
- Add a fallback function that allows recovery of locked rewards even after a token has been removed from the whitelist
