# Rewards rate can be diluted by attacker

### Summary

Attacker can donate 1 wei in `notifyRewardAmount` and dilute the rewards rate.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

The `rate` is re-calculated with the full `duration` when a reward is added.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker donates 1 wei of reward token in `notifyRewardAmount`.

### Impact

The reward rate is diluted by attacker, and extending the reward period, causing grief for honest users/protocol.
