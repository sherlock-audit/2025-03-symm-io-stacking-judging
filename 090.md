# `Vesting::__vesting_init()` Function Should Use `onlyInitializing` Instead of `initializer`


## Root Cause

The [Vesting::__vesting_init()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76) function uses the `initializer` modifier from the OpenZeppelin Initializable contract instead of the `onlyInitializing` modifier.

This causes an issue when the deployer attempts to call [SymmVesting::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L55-L65).

The `initializer` modifier includes logic that prevents it from being called multiple times in a call chain, as shown in the following excerpt from the OpenZeppelin `Initializable` contract:


```javascript
modifier initializer() {
    // ...
    if (!initialSetup && !construction) {
        revert InvalidInitialization();
    }
    // ...
}
```

When `SymmVesting::initialize()` (which also uses the `initializer` modifier) calls `Vesting::__vesting_init()` internally, the second invocation of the initializer modifier triggers the `InvalidInitialization` revert, halting the initialization process.

## Recommended Mitigation

To resolve this issue, replace the `initializer` modifier with `onlyInitializing` in the `Vesting::__vesting_init()` function.

The onlyInitializing modifier is designed for internal initialization functions called within an initialization chain, avoiding conflicts with the top-level initializer modifier. Update the code as follows:

```diff
- function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public initializer {
+ function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public onlyInitializing {
```

With this change, the deployer can successfully call SymmVesting::initialize() without encountering a revert.

## Summary

The `SymmVesting` contract inherits from the `Vesting` contract.

Both contracts define an `initialize()` function, and both use the `initializer` modifier.

When the deployer calls `SymmVesting::initialize()`, it internally invokes `Vesting::__vesting_init()`.

However, since `SymmVesting::initialize()` has already triggered the `initializer` modifier, the subsequent call to `Vesting::__vesting_init()` (which also uses `initializer`) causes a revert due to the OpenZeppelin Initializable contractâ€™s logic. 

Switching to `onlyInitializing` for `Vesting::__vesting_init()` resolves this conflict by allowing it to be called as part of the initialization process without interfering with the top-level modifier.

## Impact

the deployer will be unable to initialize the `SymmVesting` contract. This leaves the contract in an uninitialized state indefinitely, rendering it unusable for its intended purpose.
