# Anyone can delay reward distribution by calling notifyRewardAmount with minimal Deposits

## Summary
An attacker can continuously delay the distribution of staking rewards by calling notifyRewardAmount() with small amounts of tokens. Since each call extends the periodFinish by duration, this prevents timely reward distribution to stakers.

## Root Cause
The function notifyRewardAmount() updates the periodFinish to block.timestamp + duration every time it is called, regardless of the deposited amount. This allows any user to extend the reward period indefinitely by calling the function with small token amounts.

## Attack Path
- The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount() with a very small amount of a reward token.
- The function updates the reward period finish time (periodFinish = block.timestamp + duration), delaying the reward distribution.
- The attacker repeats the process, ensuring that periodFinish never arrives, effectively preventing users from claiming their rewards.

## Impact
Reward distribution for stakers will be delayed.

## Mitigation
Add access control in notifyRewardAmount().
