# Either loss of fund (reward token) for the Protocol or Legitimate users unable to  withdraw their claimable reward token

### Summary

In `SymmStaking` contract, if there's locked claimable fund (blacklisted USDC account), failure to update `pendingRewards[token]` would cause fund loss for the protocol or deprive legitimate users of their claimable funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275C2-L292C3

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343C2-L346C3

If a user or some users gets blacklisted from rewards tokens like(USDC, USDT..) after staking, they can not claim their reward tokens, Even the admin or reward manager can't force this claim and these funds gets locked.

When a distribution period is over, these locked funds remain there, `pendingRewards[token] = locked fund +dust.`  When admin calls  `notifyRewardAmount()` again to start a distribution period with some funds, this locked funds get added with the amount admin provided.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}

```
Thus, reward rate is calculated on this `total amount = amount + locked funds` which is misleading.
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
 Users can claim upto `amount`  and  ` reward rate` is higher than it should be. As a results, the users who would claim earlier get more than they should get. After `amount` of reward tokens claimed, the later users would get none.

However the admin can rescue these locked funds and redirect these funds to the reward distribution.
```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```
But `pendingRewards[token]` is not updated here. So, it would deprive legitimate users. And to mitigate this, protocol have to provide additional reward tokens in every rounds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No-Response

### External Pre-conditions

1 users get blacklisted against reward tokens(USDC....) after depositing.

### Attack Path

No-Response

### Impact

Impact is high, Likelihood is  high

### PoC

This poc is done changing the default duration for simplification purpose
`uint256 public constant DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1000 seconds;`

```solidity
it.only("User can not claim", async function () {

			const depositUser1 = "500"
			const depositUser2 = "500"


			console.log("User one deposits")



			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositUser1)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositUser1, user1.address)

			console.log("User two deposits")
			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositUser2)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).deposit(depositUser2, user2.address)


			const rewardAmount = "1000"
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])
			

			await time.increase(1100)


			// user one claim his tokens and user2 get blacklisted and can not claim
			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			console.log("User one claimed", user1Claimed)





			// As User2 is blacklisted, he can not claim so he withdraw his SYMM tokens
			console.log("User2 withdrawing amount.")
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).withdraw(depositUser2, user2.address)


			//Admin must provide at least 1000 tokens otherwise user1 won't be able to claim

			const rewardAmount1 = "999"
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount1)
			//await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount1])



			await time.increase(1100)



			//user one claims 0 tokens
			const user1BalanceBefore1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed1 = user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1
			console.log("User one claimed", user1Claimed1)

		})

```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
   +           if(isRewardToken[token])
   +                      pendingRewards[token]-=amount;
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```
