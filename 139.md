# Claiming Small Amount of Locked Token Allowing Complete Penalty Fee Bypass


## Summary

The `Vesting.sol` contract has a rounding vulnerability in its `claimLockedToken` function that allows users to completely bypass the 50% penalty when claiming locked tokens. By claiming tokens in small increments (1 token at a time), users can exploit integer rounding behavior in Solidity to pay zero penalty instead of the intended 50%, enabling them to extract 100% of their locked tokens without penalty.

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L290

In the `claimLockedToken` function, the penalty calculation is implemented as:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = amount * lockedClaimPenalty / 1e18;
uint256 userAmount = amount - penalty;
```

When processing small token amounts (such as 1 token), and with `lockedClaimPenalty = 0.5e18` (50%), the penalty calculation becomes:
```solidity
penalty = 1 * 0.5e18 / 1e18 = 0.5
```

Due to Solidity's integer division, this 0.5 value is rounded down to 0, resulting in:
- User receives: 1 token (full amount)
- Penalty receiver: 0 tokens (instead of 0.5 tokens)

## POC
Add this test to describe("claimLockedToken") in vesting.behavior.ts
```solidity
it.only("should handle extremely small amounts when claiming locked tokens", async () => {
  // Try to claim with amount = 1 (check for rounding issues)
  const user = await context.signers.user1.getAddress();
  const token = await context.symmioToken.getAddress();
  
  // Log the locked amount before claiming
  const lockedAmount = await symmVesting.getLockedAmountsForToken(user, token);
  console.log("Locked Vesting Amount", lockedAmount);
  
  // Check penalty receiver balance before claiming
  const penaltyBefore = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver());
  console.log("penaltyBefore", penaltyBefore);
  
  // Claim 1 token
  await symmVesting.connect(context.signers.user1).claimLockedToken(token, 1);
  
  // Check penalty receiver balance after claiming
  const penaltyAfter = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver());
  console.log("penaltyAfter", penaltyAfter);
  
  // Check if penalty is applied correctly (should be 0.5 token, rounded to either 0 or 1)
  const penaltyDiff = penaltyAfter - penaltyBefore;
  console.log("penaltyDiff", penaltyDiff);
  
  // Verify penalty applied is either 0 or 1
  expect(penaltyDiff).to.be.oneOf([0n, 1n]);
});
```

```solidity
Locked Vesting Amount 1000n
penaltyBefore 0n
penaltyAfter 0n
penaltyDiff 0n
```

A sophisticated user can exploit this by repeatedly claiming 1 token at a time until their entire token allocation is withdrawn without paying any penalty.

## Impact

This vulnerability has high impact because:

1. **Complete Bypass of Economic Model**: Users can completely circumvent the 50% penalty mechanism designed to discourage early withdrawals.

2. **Financial Loss to Protocol**: The protocol's penalty receiver address (typically the treasury) loses 50% of all tokens claimed early.

3. **Tokenomics Disruption**: Undermines the vesting schedule enforcement, potentially allowing mass exodus of tokens meant to be locked.

While exploitation requires multiple transactions with corresponding gas costs, the financial benefit significantly outweighs these costs for any meaningful token amount. For example, on a 10,000 token position, a user could save 5,000 tokens worth of penalty fees by paying only a fraction of that in gas costs.

## Recommendations

**Add a Minimum Claim Amount**:
```solidity
// Add a constant
uint256 public constant MINIMUM_CLAIM_AMOUNT = 100;  // Adjust as appropriate

function claimLockedToken(address token, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (amount < MINIMUM_CLAIM_AMOUNT) revert AmountTooSmall();
    // Rest of function unchanged
}
```


These changes would prevent users from exploiting the rounding behavior while maintaining the intended penalty mechanism.
