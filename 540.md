# Unrestricted Reward Addition Leading to Reward Dilution

### Summary

The missing access control in `notifyRewardAmount` will cause reward dilution and extended payout periods for stakers as anyone will repeatedly call the function with minimal amounts, reducing the reward rate over time

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol`, the function `notifyRewardAmount` does not have any access control, allowing any external actor to call it and add arbitrary amounts of rewards. This extends the reward period indefinitely and dilutes the effective reward rate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must be deployed and actively distributing rewards.
2. There must be existing reward tokens allocated for distribution.
3. The function `notifyRewardAmount` must be callable by anyone.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker or malicious user must send small amounts of tokens through `notifyRewardAmount` repeatedly.
2. There are no external controls limiting how often `notifyRewardAmount` can be called.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount([token], [1])` repeatedly.
2. Each call extends `periodFinish`, pushing the reward distribution further into the future.
3. As new rewards are added in small amounts, the reward rate is recalculated and **continually shrinks**.
4. `Stakers` receive increasingly lower rewards per time unit, making the staking contract less attractive.

### Impact

- The `stakers` suffer a loss of rewards due to reward dilution.
- The protocol suffers an extended payout period, reducing the efficiency of rewards distribution.
- The attacker gains nothing financially but can grief the system, making staking less appealing.

/**
	 * @notice Notifies the contract about new reward amounts.
	 * @param tokens Array of reward token addresses.
	 * @param amounts Array of reward amounts corresponding to each token.
	 */
//@audit no access control
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
results in reward dilution

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@audit>>. state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Mitigation

1. **Add access control**: Restrict `notifyRewardAmount` to only an admin or governance-controlled address.
2. **Set a minimum threshold**: Prevent `notifyRewardAmount` calls with amounts below a reasonable limit.
3. **Limit period extension**: Ensure that `periodFinish` does not extend indefinitely with each small addition.
