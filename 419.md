# Unintended Constraint on _resetVestingPlans Leading to DoS

### Summary

The `_resetVestingPlans` function imposes a constraint that prevents resetting a vesting plan if the new `amount` is less than the already `unlockedAmount()`. This leads to issues in functions that depend on `_resetVestingPlans`, particularly `resetVestingPlans`, `addLiquidity`, and `addLiquidityByPercentage`. Users with a vested amount that has already been unlocked beyond the new allocation will be unable to reset their plan, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS).

### Root Cause

1. **Strict Constraint on Amount Reduction:**
      https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231
      - The check above ensures that the new vesting amount must always be greater than the unlocked amount.
      - Since `unlockedAmount()` increases over time, this constraint becomes **progressively stricter** until the full amount is unlocked.
      - If the vesting period has fully elapsed, the userâ€™s `unlockedAmount()` equals the full amount, making it **impossible to reset to a lower amount**.

2. **Effects on `resetVestingPlans`:**

    - If the `resetVestingPlans` function is called after the vesting period ends, the **new amount must always be greater than the previous amount**, leading to an ever-increasing allocation requirement.
    - Eventually, the required amount becomes **too large**, resulting in an unintended **denial of service (DoS)** when the function can no longer be called.

3. **Effects on `addLiquidity` and `addLiquidityByPercentage`:**

    - These functions depend on `_resetVestingPlans` to determine the amount of `SYMM_LP` tokens a user can add.
    - If the returned `SYMM_LP` amount is **smaller than the previously unlocked amount**, the function will **revert**, blocking users from adding liquidity unless their `SYMM` balance is sufficiently large.
    - Users whose `SYMM` holdings are not significantly larger than their unlocked balance will be effectively `locked out` of participating in liquidity provision, **leading to a system-wide liquidity risk.**

### Impact

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) for Vesting Plan Resets**

    - Users cannot reset vesting plans to lower amounts if their unlocked balance has exceeded the new allocation.
    - Once vesting is fully unlocked, the function **cannot be called anymore** unless a larger allocation is provided.
 
2. **Liquidity Addition Fails**
    - Users who attempt to add liquidity but receive a **lower SYMM_LP amount** than their already unlocked balance will be **unable to proceed**, reducing overall liquidity participation.

3. Forced Allocation Growth

    - Since resetting requires the new amount to be greater than `unlockedAmount()`, vesting allocations may **continuously increase**, leading to **unexpected inflation** in total vested amounts.

### PoC

paste in token/tests/symmVesting.behavior.ts
```solidity
it("unintended Constraint DOS addLiquidity for user", async () => {
	await symmVesting.connect(user1).addLiquidity(e(600), 0, user1UsdcAmount)

	await time.increase(1.2e7)

	const lockedAmountBefore = await symmVesting.getLockedAmountsForToken(await user1.getAddress(), await symmToken.getAddress())

	await symmVesting.connect(user1).addLiquidity(lockedAmountBefore - e("0.05"), 0, user1UsdcAmount)
})
```

### Mitigation

Modify the check to allow resetting to lower amounts if necessary.
