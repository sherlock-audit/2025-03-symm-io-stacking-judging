# Admin will DoS reward manager from blacklisting tokens by leaving the `SymmStaking` contract in an inconsistent state

### Summary

Lack of synchronization between `SymmStaking.sol:rescueTokens()` and `SymmStaking.sol:pendingRewards[token]` will cause the reward manager to not be able to blacklist a token as the admin will leave the contract in an inconsistent state after rescuing tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343-L346
`rescueTokens()`s failure to update `pendingRewards[token]` when tokens are withdrawn leaves it unchanged, blocking blacklisting in `configureRewardToken()` if `pendingRewards[token] > 10`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `pendingRewards[token]` to be more than 10.
2. Admin needs to call `rescueTokens()` to remove the tokens balance from the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

If pre-conditions are set, the reward manager's call on `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to blacklist a token will fail.

### Impact

The token will not be able to be blacklisted and pendingRewards[token] will have a value that cannot be disbursed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism that claims all rewards before rescuing tokens or drain `pendingRewards[token]` before rescuing them.
