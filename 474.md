# Attacker will steal funds from protocol users.

### Summary

The vulnerability is caused by improper initialization in the upgradeable contracts **SymmStaking** and **SymmVesting**. An attacker can call an open initializer (or the base initializer) before the legitimate admin does, thereby setting themselves as the contract’s administrator. This not only grants them full control to withdraw funds and manipulate vesting schedules but also leaves critical variables uninitialized. Additionally, the absence of a storage gap (`__gap`) in SymmStaking may lead to storage collisions during future upgrades, risking further corruption of contract data.


### Root Cause

- **Incorrect Initialization Modifiers:**  
  - In **SymmVesting**, the base function `__vesting_init` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76 is declared as `public initializer` instead of `internal onlyInitializing`. This allows external calls that mark the contract as initialized prematurely.
  - In **SymmStaking**, while `initialize` is correctly marked as `initializer`, it lacks role restrictions—allowing any address to call it before proper initialization.
- **Lack of Storage Gap in SymmStaking:**  
  - SymmStaking does not reserve a storage gap (`__gap`), risking storage collisions in future upgrades. This may overwrite parent contract slots when new state variables are introduced.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Contract Not Yet Initialized:**  
   - The internal `_initialized` flag is `false` immediately after proxy deployment.
2. **Open Initializer Functions:**  
   - Functions like `__vesting_init` and `initialize` are publicly accessible, allowing the first caller to set the admin.
3. **No Admin Privileges Set:**  
   - Before initialization, there is no defined `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, so the first call assigns admin rights to the caller.


### External Pre-conditions

1. **Proxy Deployment (EIP-1967):**  
   - The contracts are deployed behind a transparent proxy, separating logic and storage.
2. **Delayed Initialization:**  
   - Initialization is performed after deployment, creating a window during which an unauthorized caller can invoke the initializer.
3. **No External Dependencies:**  
   - The exploit requires no external data; it relies solely on the public availability of the initialization functions.


### Attack Path

1. **Monitoring Deployment:**  
   - The attacker watches for the proxy deployment of SymmStaking/SymmVesting that hasn’t yet been initialized.
2. **Calling Initialize:**  
   - The attacker sends a transaction calling `initialize(attacker_address, _stakingToken)` (or directly `__vesting_init` for SymmVesting) on the proxy.
   - The `initializer` modifier marks the contract as initialized, and the attacker becomes the admin for SymmStaking; for SymmVesting).
3. **Exploitation:**  
   - With admin rights, the attacker can invoke admin-only functions (e.g., `rescueTokens`) to withdraw all staked tokens and rewards, or manipulate vesting schedules to reassign tokens.
4. **Securing Control:**  
   - The attacker leaves the contract in a compromised state, blocking legitimate administration and disrupting protocol functions.


### Impact

- **Loss of Control:**  
  - The attacker seizes full administrative control, preventing the legitimate owner from managing the contract.
- **Theft of Funds:**  
  - In SymmStaking, the attacker can withdraw all staked tokens and rewards.
  - In SymmVesting, tokens intended for vesting can be reallocated and claimed immediately.
- **Operational Disruption:**  
  - The contract may be left paused or misconfigured, halting user withdrawals and claims.
- **Upgrade Risks:**  
  - Without a `__gap`, future upgrades of SymmStaking risk storage collisions, leading to unpredictable behavior.


### PoC

1. **Setup:**  
   - Deploy the proxy for SymmStaking or SymmVesting without proper initialization.
2. **Exploit:**  
   - From an attacker-controlled address, call `initialize(attacker_address, _stakingToken)` (or directly `__vesting_init` for SymmVesting).
3. **Result:**  
   - The contract’s initialized flag is set, and the attacker’s address becomes the admin.
4. **Follow-up:**  
   - The attacker can then invoke admin-only functions (e.g., `rescueTokens`) to withdraw all funds.


### Mitigation

- **Secure Base Initialization:**  
  - Change `__vesting_init` to `internal onlyInitializing` to ensure it is only called from within `SymmVesting.initialize`.
- **Add a Storage Gap:**  
  - Insert `uint256[50] private __gap;` at the end of SymmStaking to reserve storage for future variables.
- **Restrict Access to Initialization:**  
  - Limit `initialize` so it can only be called by an authorized deployer (e.g., via `require(msg.sender == proxyAdmin)`), closing the initialization window.
- **Follow OpenZeppelin Standards:**  
  - Use versioned reinitializers (`reinitializer(version)`) for future upgrades and ensure all base classes are properly initialized with `onlyInitializing`.
- **Preinitialize the Implementation:**  
  - Optionally, call `initialize` on the implementation with dummy values to prevent direct external calls on the logic contract.
