# `configureAirdrop` will DoS if array gets too large.

### Summary

In `AirDropHelper::configureAirdrop` it does an unbounded for loop iterating with the `recipients.lenght` array. However, if this array gets too large to the point that trespass the block gas limit, the transaction may revert and cause a DoS (Denial of Service) everytime is called by the owner, causing the functionallity to configure the airdrops using recipients and amounts unusable and will revert.

### Root Cause

In `configureAirdrop` the loop iterates over the entire length of the recipients array:

If recipient array gets too large, this loop will iterate over so much recipients and will cost gas to iterate over all of them, that might trespass the block gas limit after a certain number



### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner has to call `configureAirdrop`

### External Pre-conditions

Recipients array has get very big.

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `configureAirdrop` in order to start an Airdrop
2.  Array is very big: This can happen in two ways:
3. Attacker either creates multiple addresses in order to interact with the array
4. Or it's just crowded by multiple users who just want to airdrop tokens.
5. Loop interacts thru every users in the array and makes a push call for every person on `_airdropRecipients` array and for every amount on `_airdropAmounts` to get them to the recipient and and the amount array
6. Loop has to interact with every user and it costs a lot of gas
7. The function gets DoS because it surpass the block gas limit. 

### Impact

Owner can't configureAirdrops and it might compromise the whole token airdrop system for the Symm token on Aerodrome

### PoC

Add this to your AirdropHelperBehavior.ts file : 

```js
describe("Configuration", () => {
		beforeEach(async () => {
			// Clear any existing config
			await airdropHelper.connect(owner).clearAirdropConfig();

			// Setup new config for each test
			const recipients = [await user1.getAddress(), await user2.getAddress(), await user3.getAddress()];
			const amounts = [ethers.parseEther("10"), ethers.parseEther("20"), ethers.parseEther("30")];
			await airdropHelper.connect(owner).configureAirdrop(recipients, amounts);
		});

		it("should fail due to out of gas in transferAirdrops with large batch array size", async () => {
			const recipients = Array(1000000000).fill(await user1.getAddress());
			const amounts = Array(1000000000).fill(ethers.parseEther("1"));

			await airdropHelper.connect(owner).configureAirdrop(recipients, amounts);

			await expect(airdropHelper.connect(owner).transferAirdrops(1000000000)).to.be.reverted;
		});
```

To test this, you do 

```bash
 npx hardhat test --grep "should fail due to out of gas in configureAirdrop with large arrays"

```


### Mitigation

Adding a way we can process `recipients` and `amounts` array in smaller batchSizes:

```diff
function configureAirdrop(address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata amounts) external onlyOwner {
		if (recipients.length != amounts.length) revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
		if (recipients.length == 0) revert EmptyArrays();
+        uint256 batchSize = 100; // Define a batch size to process in chunks
+        uint256 totalBatches = (recipients.length + batchSize - 1) / batchSize; // Calculate the total number of batches
+      for (uint256 batch = 0; batch < totalBatches; batch++) {
+        uint256 start = batch * batchSize;
+         uint256 end = start + batchSize > recipients.length ? recipients.length : start + batchSize;

+            for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
+              if (recipients[i] == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
+             if (amounts[i] == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
+           _airdropRecipients.push(recipients[i]);
+         _airdropAmounts.push(amounts[i]);
+       totalConfiguredAirdrop += amounts[i];
+  }
+  }


-		for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; ) {
-			if (recipients[i] == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
-			if (amounts[i] == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
-
-			_airdropRecipients.push(recipients[i]);
-			_airdropAmounts.push(amounts[i]);
-			totalConfiguredAirdrop += amounts[i]; 
-			unchecked {
-				++i;
-			}
-		}

		emit AirdropConfigured(totalConfiguredAirdrop, recipients.length);
	}
```
