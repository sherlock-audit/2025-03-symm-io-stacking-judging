# Any user can disrupt reward distribution in the staking contract by notifying invalid rewards

### Summary

Root Cause: In SymmStaking.sol, the notifyRewardAmount function lacks access control.
Impact: Attackers can manipulate reward distribution rates for whitelisted tokens, causing stakers to receive fewer rewards than expected.

### Root Cause

Code Issue: In [SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292), the notifyRewardAmount function is callable by any user (no onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) modifier).

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to allow open access to reward notifications is a mistake, as it violates the protocolâ€™s intended reward management logic.
```solidity
@>	   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must hold a small amount of a whitelisted reward token (e.g., USDC).
2. The target reward token must be in an active reward period (rewardState[token].periodFinish > block.timestamp).

### External Pre-conditions

2. The Balancer pool for the reward token must have sufficient liquidity (to pass token transfers).

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a whitelisted reward token (e.g., USDC) with an ongoing reward period.

2. Attacker calls: notifyRewardAmount([USDC], [1 wei])  
3. The contract transfers 1 wei of USDC from the attacker.
4. Reward rate recalculation:
uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; // Small residual from previous period  
state.rate = (1 wei + leftover) / DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;  
If leftover is negligible, state.rate becomes 0.
5. Result: Subsequent rewards for stakers are diluted or halted.

### Impact

The stakers suffer an approximate loss of their expected rewards, potentially receiving zero or negligible rewards during the manipulated period. The attacker does not gain a direct financial benefit but disrupts the staking system, potentially causing distrust and withdrawal of staked funds by users (griefing).

1. Stakers suffer a loss of expected rewards due to manipulated rates.

2. Protocol faces reputational damage and potential loss of staking participation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to notifyRewardAmount:
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)  
    external  
    nonReentrant  
    whenNotPaused  
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) // Add this modifier  
{ ... }
