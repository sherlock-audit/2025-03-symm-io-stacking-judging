# Inability to Remove Reward Token Due to Rounding Issues in configureRewardToken

### Summary

The function configureRewardToken allows administrators to add or remove reward tokens. However, the condition pendingRewards[token] > 10 is ineffective due to rounding issues in reward distribution calculations. As a result, reward tokens may become permanently non-removable, leading to governance and protocol inefficiencies.

### Root Cause

When rewards are notified, pendingRewards[token] is incremented by the deposited amount.
The reward rate is calculated using integer division (state.rate = amount / state.duration), which causes rounding down. When users claim rewards, the claimable amount is also rounded down, leading to discrepancies between distributed and pending rewards.
Due to these rounding issues, pendingRewards[token] rarely drops below 10, making the condition ineffective for token removal.

```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

notifyRewardAmount increases pendingRewards[token]
state.rate = amount / state.duration leads to rounding down, causing a mismatch between expected and actual reward distribution
Users claiming rewards further reduce pendingRewards[token] in a rounded-down manner, making it nearly impossible to reach exactly 10 or below.

### External Pre-conditions

### Impact

Prevents proper reward token management by admin
Leads to accumulation of unnecessary reward tokens

### PoC

```solidity

	describe("Reward Calculation", function () {
		it("should still pending rewards left when all claimed", async function () {
			// Scenario: Single depositor â€” user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM, waits 200s, claims 200 tokens.

			const depositAmount = "604900"
			const rewardAmount = depositAmount
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)


			const pending = await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await stakingToken.getAddress());
			expect(pending).to.equal(depositAmount);

			await time.increase(100*24*60*60)


			const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			expect(claimed).to.equal("604797")
		})
	})
```

### Mitigation

Replace pendingRewards[token] > 10 with a more flexible threshold, such as a percentage of total rewards or a higher absolute limit
