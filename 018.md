# An attacker will gain complete control over the vesting contract through unprotected initialization

### Summary

The public initialize function in SymmVesting.sol will cause a complete loss of funds for all users as an attacker can reinitialize the contract and gain admin privileges.

### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol:initialize#L55-L85` 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L55-L85' the initialize function is marked as public without access control, allowing anyone to call it before the legitimate deployment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be deployed but not yet initialized.
2. Legitimate admin has not called initialize function yet.

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external preconditions required.

### Attack Path

  1. Attacker monitors the mempool for the SymmVesting contract deployment.
  2. Attacker frontrunns the legitimate initialization call with their own parameters.
  3. Attacker sets themselves as admin and penalty receiver.
  4. Attacker gains full control of the contract including:
     - Setting vesting schedules
     - Pausing the contract
     - Managing all roles
     - Receiving all penalty fees

### Impact

  The users and protocol suffer a complete loss of funds and control. The attacker gains:
  - Full admin access to manage all aspects of vesting
  - Ability to steal all penalty fees
  - Power to block legitimate users from claiming tokens
  - Control over pausing/unpausing functionality

          assertTrue(vesting.hasRole(vesting.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE(), attacker));
          
          // Verify original admin cannot initialize
          vm.expectRevert("Initializable: contract is already initialized");
          vesting.initialize(
              address(this), // legitimate admin
              address(this), // legitimate receiver
              address(1),
              address(1),
              address(1),
              address(1),
              address(1),
              address(1),
              address(1)
          );
      }
  }
  ```

### Mitigation

  1. Make initialize function internal or private.
  2. Create a factory contract that handles deployment and initialization atomically.
  3. Use a proxy pattern that combines deployment and initialization in one transaction.
  4. Add access control to initialize function if it must remain public.
