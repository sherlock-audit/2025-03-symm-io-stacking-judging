# Malicious User Can Permanently Block `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` From Removing Reward Tokens

### Summary


An insufficient validation check in the `configureRewardToken` function allows any user to permanently prevent the removal of whitelisted reward tokens by making small deposits that exceed the hardcoded threshold. This results in a DOS for the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`, as they are unable to remove tokens from the whitelist once the pendingRewards value exceeds 10 wei.



### Root Cause



In [`configureRewardToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312) the function contains a check that prevents removing a token from the whitelist if its `pendingRewards` value is greater than 10:

```solidity
if (!status) {
    if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
    // Code to remove token from rewardTokens array
}
```

This check is intended to prevent admin from removing tokens that still have significant pending rewards. However, the threshold is set extremely low (just 10 wei) and any user can call `notifyRewardAmount` to contribute a trivial amount of tokens, permanently blocking the admin from removing that token from the whitelist.

A malicious user can exploit this by repeatedly calling `notifyRewardAmount` with small amounts:


```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
    notifyRewardAmount([TokenA], [1]); // 1 wei
}
```

For the first iteration, `state.rate = amount / state.duration` results in `1 / 604800 = 0`. However, `pendingRewards[token] += amount` is still updated to 1.  

In subsequent iterations, `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration` becomes `(1 + 0) / 604800`, which again results in a rate of 0. Despite this, `pendingRewards[token] += amount` is incremented each time. After 11 such iterations, `pendingRewards[token]` becomes 11.  

Due to the logic of the contract, the `pendingRewards` mapping never decreases. As a result, the admin can never unwhitelist this token once the `pendingRewards` value exceeds the hardcoded threshold of 10.

```solidity
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token must be already whitelisted as a reward token (i.e., `isRewardToken[token] == true`)
2. The user needs to have at least 11 wei of the reward token to transfer


### External Pre-conditions

n/a


### Attack Path

- A malicious user call the `notifyRewardAmount` function multiple times with a small amount (e.g., 1 wei) to increment the `pendingRewards` value for a specific token. Each call increases the `pendingRewards` value by the amount provided.

- The `state.rate` calculation results in 0 because the amount (1 wei) divided by the duration (604800 seconds) is negligible. However, the `pendingRewards[token]` is still incremented by 1 wei in each iteration.

- After 11 iterations, the `pendingRewards[token]` value becomes 11, which exceeds the hardcoded threshold of 10. Since the `pendingRewards` mapping never decreases because rate is zero, the token is permanently blocked from being removed from the whitelist.


### Impact

Permanent DOS for token management functionality that prevents the contract for removing reward tokens. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Allow only authorized roles to call notifyRewardAmount function
