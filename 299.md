# `_claimLockedToken` Could Allow Users To Bypass Penalty Payment To `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`

### Summary

Integer truncation in the penalty calculation will cause an unintended bypass of penalty payments for `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` as users will claim locked tokens without sending the intended penalty portion.

### Root Cause

In `Vesting.sol::_claimLockedToken`, the penalty calculation, `uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;`  suffers from integer truncation. Since Solidity does not support floating-point arithmetic, if `lockedClaimPenalty` is less than 1e18 (i.e., 100%), the result of the multiplication divided by 1e18 will truncate to 0 due to integer division. This allows users to claim their full `amount` of locked tokens without any penalty being deducted or sent to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `SETTER_ROLE` needs to set `lockedClaimPenalty` to be less than 1e18 (e.g., 0.1e18 for a 10% penalty).

2. A user needs to have a vesting plan with a non-zero `lockedAmount` for a given token.



### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `claimLockedToken(token, amount)` with a valid `amount` of locked tokens they are entitled to claim.

2. The function `_claimLockedToken` calculates the penalty as `(amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18`.

3. Due to integer truncation e.g., 
```javascript
if lockedClaimPenalty = 0.1e18,
then penalty = (amount * 0.1e18) / 1e18 = 0),   
the penalty is set to 0.
```

4. The full amount is transferred to the user via `IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty) (where penalty = 0)`.

5. No tokens are transferred to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` via `IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty)` since `penalty = 0`.



### Impact

The `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` suffers an approximate loss of the intended penalty amount (e.g., 10% of amount if lockedClaimPenalty = 0.1e18). The user gains the full amount of locked tokens without any deduction, effectively bypassing the penalty mechanism.


### PoC

Add this test to `vesting.behaviours.ts` under `claimLockedToken` tests:

```typescript
it("should claim all lockd amount without paying fees", async () => {
			// get the current lockedClaimPenalty
			const penalty = await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenalty()
			console.log("penalty", penalty.toString())


			const oldPenaltyContractBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver())
			const oldUserBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1)

			// Loop to call claimLockedToken 1000 times
			for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
				await symmVesting.connect(context.signers.user1).claimLockedToken(context.symmioToken, 1);
			}

			const newPenaltyContractBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver())
			const newUserBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1)

			await expect (newPenaltyContractBalance).to.be.equal(oldPenaltyContractBalance + BigInt(0))
			await expect (newUserBalance).to.be.equal(oldUserBalance + BigInt(1000))
		})
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum lockedClaimPenalty value during initialization or updates to ensure itâ€™s sufficiently large to avoid truncation issues (e.g., scale penalties in a higher base unit like 1e6 instead of 1e18 if smaller percentages are desired).
