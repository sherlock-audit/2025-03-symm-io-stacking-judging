# User is able to claim locked token without paying penalty

### Summary

In Vesting.sol, the setter role configures the vesting plan by specifying the token address, start time, end time, recipient addresses, and the allocated amounts for each user. The contract gradually unlocks tokens over time, ensuring that by the end of the vesting period, all tokens are fully distributed.

Users can claim their unlocked tokens at any time based on the elapsed duration. Additionally, they have the option to claim locked tokens before they are fully vested, but this incurs a penalty fee. However, there's a flaw in the penalty calculation: when a user calls claimLockedToken with an amount of 1, the penalty rounds down to zero due to the formula:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
```

Where:
amount is 1
lockedClaimPenalty is 500000000000000000   simplified  5e17

This allows a user to repeatedly claim locked tokens in small increments without incurring any penalty, effectively bypassing the intended vesting restrictions and draining their allocation ahead of schedule.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;  <-------------

		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);
		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
		
		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
```

because lockedClaimPenalty is 1e17  by calling it with amount 1    it results in 1e17 / 1e18 which rounds down to 0
and user ends up without paying any penalty fee

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

SETTER_ROLE sets a vestingPlan
User calls  claimLockedToken with amount 1
after many repeats he completely gets his full vestingPlan without paying any penalty fee.

### Impact

User gets all his tokens from the vestingPlan ahead of the time without paying any penalty fees.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Add minimum claimable amount

```solidity
require(amount >= MIN_CLAIM_AMOUNT, "Amount too small");
```

Or add check if penalty is 0 to revert

```solidity
if(penalty == 0) revert;
```
