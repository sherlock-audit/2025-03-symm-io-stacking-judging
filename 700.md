# If the protocol was banned from USDT while the contract still has balance, given the `configureRewardToken` check, it might become unremovable, causing frequent reverted transactions

### Summary

USDT has blacklisting posibilities.
If that were to happen with the protocol, given the check it has inside the configureRewardToken function, checking whether the contract has more than 10 tokens (and otherwise reverting) the protocol might be unable to remove the token from its whitelisted tokens. And given that users won't be able to redeem any reward for USDT in such a case, the token will always have rewards.

```javascript
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]); //problematic line, USDT balance could be greater than 10 if blacklisted
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320

This check inside the function creates the issue:
```javascript
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. SymmStaking.sol adds USDT as one of their allowed tokens
2. has more than 10 tokens inside

### External Pre-conditions

1. SymStaking is blacklisted from USDT.

### Attack Path

1. The contract has more than 10 USDT tokens
2. USDT protocol bans the SymmStaking contract
3. The contract cant remove USDT
4. all USDT transactions will remove, while the token is still allowed

### Impact

Severely impacts user experience, having an allowed token (apparently with rewards) but that still does not work
