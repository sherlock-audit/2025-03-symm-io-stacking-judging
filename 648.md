# Issue with Reward Token Removal Protection in Staking Contract


### **Summary:**
The current logic in the `configureRewardToken` function allows for a potential exploit where an attacker can prevent the admin from removing a reward token from the whitelist. This issue arises because the check for removing a token from the reward list is based on the `pendingRewards[token]` being greater than 10. An attacker could add a small amount, such as 10 WEI, to the contract to keep the `pendingRewards[token]` above this threshold, thus preventing the admin from removing the token from the whitelist. This manipulation allows tokens to persist in the reward list indefinitely, despite the admin's intention to remove them.

### **Root Cause:**
The check to prevent removal of tokens from the reward list relies on the value of `pendingRewards[token]`. If the amount in `pendingRewards[token]` is greater than 10, the function prevents the token from being removed. However, an attacker can add a very small amount (e.g., 10 WEI) to the `pendingRewards[token]`, causing it to exceed the threshold and thus making it impossible for the admin to remove the token from the reward list.

### **Impact:**
- **Persistence of Unwanted Tokens**: Malicious actors can prevent the removal of specific tokens from the reward list by manipulating the `pendingRewards[token]`, which could lead to unwanted tokens staying in circulation for longer than desired.
- **Admin's Control Reduced**: Admin's ability to manage and configure reward tokens effectively is diminished, as attackers can thwart their actions by adding trivial amounts to prevent removal.

### **Attack Path:**
1. **Attacker adds a small amount (e.g., 10 WEI)** of a specific token to the contract, increasing the `pendingRewards[token]` above the 10 threshold.
2. **The admin attempts to remove the token from the reward list**, but the `pendingRewards[token]` check prevents the action.
3. The attacker successfully **keeps the token on the reward list**, regardless of the admin's intention to remove it.
