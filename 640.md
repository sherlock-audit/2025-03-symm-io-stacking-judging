# admin can force users to claim locked tokens and incur penalties

### Summary

The excessive centralization of privileged roles in the Symmio protocol allows the admin to force users to claim their locked tokens prematurely by calling `claimLockedTokenFor` or `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage`. This results in penalties being applied to users, with the penalty fees being transferred to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

### Root Cause

In [Vesting.sol#L76-L91](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76-L91), all critical roles (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `SETTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `UNPAUSER_ROLE`, and `OPERATOR_ROLE`) are assigned to a single user (the `admin`). This excessive centralization grants the admin the ability to execute privileged actions that should typically be under user control.

The functions `claimLockedTokenFor` and `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage` can be executed by any address with the `OPERATOR_ROLE`, specifying a user and an amount of tokens to be claimed. Due to the penalty mechanism, this results in financial losses for users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	A user must have locked SYMM tokens in the vesting contract.
2.	The admin (holding the `OPERATOR_ROLE`) access to the `claimLockedTokenFor` and `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage` functions.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.	The admin, possessing the `OPERATOR_ROLE`, calls `claimLockedTokenFor`(user, amount) or `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage`(user, percentage).
2.	The vesting contract processes the forced claim, even if the user did not intend to claim the locked tokens.
3.	A 50% penalty is applied to the claimed amount, and the penalized tokens are sent to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.
4.	The `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` address may be controlled by the admin, allowing them to unjustly collect penalties from forced claims.


### Impact

- Users can be forced to claim their locked tokens prematurely, incurring significant penalties.
- The admin can collect these penalties into an address under their control, creating a conflict of interest and a loss of trust in the protocol.
- This centralized control introduces significant risks to token holders, reducing confidence in the fairness and security of the Symmio protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Remove the ability for `OPERATOR_ROLE` to execute `claimLockedTokenFor` and `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage` on behalf of users.
- Implement a decentralized governance mechanism to prevent admin power abuse.
