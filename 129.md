# Users can reset unlockedAmount to bypass vesting plan restrictions

### Summary

The check in the `Vesting::_resetVestingPlans` function can easily be bypassed.

[Vesting::_resetVestingPlans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222) function:
```javascript
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
	address user = users[i];
	uint256 amount = amounts[i];
	_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
	VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
=>	if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
	...
    }
}
```

This check is intended to ensure that the total claimed amount of a user (`vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()`) is less than or equal the new `amount`. However, a user can bypass this check by calling the `Vesting::claimLockedToken` function. After executing this function, `vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()` is reset to `0` due to the function calling `vestingPlan.resetAmount(...)`.

### Root Cause

The condition meant to enforce that the total claimed amount of a user (`vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()`) is less than or equal the new `amount` can be bypassed after the user executes `Vesting::claimLockedToken`.

```javascript
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```

### Attack Path

1. A user has **1000 USDC** in total vested tokens.  
2. **800 USDC** has already been unlocked, with **200 USDC** still locked.  
3. The user calls the `Vesting::claimLockedToken` function with a very small `amount` parameter, resetting `vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()` to `0`.  
4. An admin resets the locked amount to **500 USDC**, and the function succeeds even though the user had previously unlocked 800 USDC.  

### Impact

When an admin resets a user's vesting plan, the total claimed amount can exceed the newly vested amount.

### Mitigation

Implement a mapping to track the total claimed amount of each user.
