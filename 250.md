# Unauthorized SYMM Token Minting During Liquidity Addition

### Summary

Admins with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can withdraw staking tokens via `rescueTokens`, rendering user withdrawals impossible and stealing funds.

### Root Cause

The `rescueTokens` function allows unrestricted withdrawal of any token, including the staking token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin has `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
2. Users have deposited staking tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin acts maliciously or is compromised.

### Attack Path

Admin calls `rescueTokens` to transfer staking tokens to their address.
Contractâ€™s staking token balance is drained.
Users cannot withdraw their staked tokens.
