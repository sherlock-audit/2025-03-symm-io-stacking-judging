# An attacker can notify 1 wei of reward token for increasing the `periodFinish` time again and again.

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` can be called by anyone, so an attacker can leverage this function in order to extend the `periodFinish` time again and again by providing 1 wei as reward token.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

Above we can see that, each time when attacker is calling this function the `state.periodFinish` updated to state.duration( 1 weaks) by current time.



### Root Cause

Attacker can call `notifyRewardAmount()`  function , in order to extend the `periodFinish` time again and again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Attacker `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei.

### Impact

If an attacker does above scenario, then users will end up claiming their rewards too late.
Attacker can delay users reward claiming.

- Let's say 100 usdc reward tokens notified initially.
- Assume userA can claim 10 tokens over 1 weak.
- UserA wants to claim all token just before 1 weak.
- Attacker notifies 1 wei of reward tokens after 1/2 weak , now userA needs to wait 1/2 weak more to claim all 10 tokens.

### Mitigation

`notifyRewardAmount()` should not be permissionless.
