# Malicious User can dilute staking Rewards to a longer timeframe

### Summary

The `SymmStaking` contract allows anyone to add new rewards using the `notifyRewardAmount` function. However, if new rewards are continuously added while existing rewards are still active, the total rewards get spread over a longer period. A malicious actor can exploit this by repeatedly adding tiny amounts, effectively delaying stakers from receiving their full rewards.



### Root Cause

* `notifyRewardAmount` function can be called by anyone, with any reward amount.

* Each time it's called, the reward rate is recalculated as:

    * `amount / state.duration` (if the previous reward period has ended).
    * [`(amount + leftover) / state.duration`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) (if the previous reward period is still ongoing).

The issue arises when an attacker keeps adding tiny amounts (e.g., 1 wei) repeatedly. While the total rewards (amount + leftover) barely change, the duration (state.duration) remains fixed at 1 week, causing the reward rate to drop significantly over time.

**Example:**

1. Alice is the only staker, and 100 USDC is added as a reward.

2. Halfway through, Alice has earned 50 USDC.

3. A malicious user then adds just 1 wei USDC as a new reward.

4. This recalculates the reward rate, cutting it in half:

    * From `100e6 / 1 week` â†’ `50e6 / 1 week`.

5. The attacker can repeat this process multiple times, continuously lowering the rate.

This DoS-like attack prevents stakers from claiming their rewards in a reasonable timeframe.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users stakes in `SymmStaking`.

2. A new reward is notified via `notifyRewardAmount` for the stakers.

3. A malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount` multiple times with dust values to dilute the reward rate.

4. User get rewards slower than what they were supposed to get.

### Impact

Time to gain the intended reward can be arbitrarily increased by malicious users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding restrictions on who can add new reward. Alternatively, implement a minimum amount of reward tokens that can be added to ensure that the total reward amount is meaningfully increased.
