# System is not EIP1967 compliant

### Summary

System is not EIP1967 compliant, but the README states that it must be.

### Root Cause

The project claims compliance with EIP-1967 in the README but fails to implement the required components. 

The implementation lacks a beacon contract and properly structured storage slots for implementations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L17
```solidity
// Contract implements upgradeability but without EIP-1967 compliance
// No implementation of required storage slots for admin, logic implementation
// Missing beacon contract functionality for proxy implementation
contract SymmStaking is ... {
}
```

Same is with the other contracts.
