# Reward Distribution blocked by whenNotPaused modifier

### Summary
When the contract is paused, the `notifyRewardAmount` function—used to add reward tokens—is blocked due to the `whenNotPaused` modifier. This means that even though deposits and stakes are halted intentionally, reward notifications (and thus reward accrual) are also blocked, preventing the vault from updating and distributing rewards to existing stakers.

### Finding Description
The issue stems from the use of the `whenNotPaused` modifier on the `notifyRewardAmount` function. While pausing is a valid mechanism to prevent new deposits or stakes during emergency situations, it is counterproductive for reward notifications:
The vault is expected to continue receiving and distributing rewards even when paused (to protect stakers from unforeseen issues or market changes). However, by halting reward notifications, the vault fails to update its reward rate and distribution logic.

### PoC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

### Impact
1. **No Reward Accumulation**: Existing stakers will not receive new rewards while the contract is paused, even if they remain staked. 
2. **Economic Disruption**: The inability to process reward notifications during pause conditions can lead to significant economic implications, as users may lose out on valuable rewards and the overall reward mechanism of the protocol becomes ineffective.

### Recommendation
To ensure that rewards continue to accrue for existing stakers even when the contract is paused (to prevent interruption of reward accumulation), it is recommended to remove the whenNotPaused modifier from the notifyRewardAmount function. This adjustment will allow reward notifications—and thus reward accrual—to proceed even if new deposits or stakes are halted.
