# Unrestricted rescueTokens in SymmStaking Allows Admin to Withdraw User Funds

# Admin will drain user funds

## Summary
A missing restriction in the `rescueTokens` function will cause critical asset misappropriation for stakers as an admin (or a compromised admin) will be able to withdraw user deposits and rewards without proper balance adjustments.

## Root Case
In the SymmStaking contract, the `rescueTokens` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343 function lacks checks to prevent withdrawing core tokens (e.g. staked SYMM and active reward tokens) and does not update internal accounting (like pendingRewards). This oversight allows an admin to extract any tokens held by the contract without considering user balances.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. **Admin Privilege:** The function is callable only by an address with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
2. **Core Token Holdings:** The contract holds staked tokens and reward tokens tracked in internal state.
3. **Lack of Restrictions:** There are no safeguards preventing the withdrawal of tokens that are integral to staking or reward distribution.

## External Pre-conditions
1. **Compromised or Malicious Admin:** The attacker either is the admin or has compromised the admin key.
2. **Active Token Balances:** The contract has non-zero balances of the staked and reward tokens.
3. **No Timelock/Multi-sig Controls:** The admin’s actions are not subject to additional delays or multiple approvals.

## Attack Path
1. The attacker (as admin) identifies that the contract holds user deposits and rewards.
2. They call `rescueTokens(token, amount, receiver)` with the address of the staked token (or reward token) and the full contract balance.
3. The function transfers the tokens to the specified receiver without updating internal records.
4. Users’ internal balances remain unchanged, but the contract’s actual token balance drops to zero, preventing legitimate withdrawals.

## Impact
The stakers suffer a complete loss of their deposited funds and rewards because the contract’s balance is drained while internal accounting still reflects user ownership. This leaves users unable to withdraw or claim tokens, effectively causing a rug pull on the protocol’s core assets.

1. Loss of Staked Funds: If the admin abuses rescueTokens, stakers can lose some or all of their deposits. This function allows the admin to transfer out user-staked tokens, enabling a potential rug-pull. After an exploit, users cannot withdraw funds, as the contract no longer holds them. In SymmStaking, all staked SYMM tokens could be siphoned away, leaving users with worthless balances.
2. Theft of Reward Pool: The admin can also drain staking rewards (e.g., SYMM emissions, USDC), depriving users of expected yields and disrupting the reward schedule. If this happens mid-distribution, some users may receive rewards while others get nothing, creating unfair outcomes and eroding trust.
3. Protocol Insolvency and Downtime: An exploit leaves contract records (e.g., balances, total supply) mismatched with reality, making the protocol insolvent. Withdrawals and claims fail, effectively shutting down the platform. Even new deposits could be at risk if the admin can still remove tokens. Without immediate recovery, the contract becomes non-functional.

## PoC
1. **Setup:**  
   - The contract holds 1000 SYMM as staked funds and 500 SYMM as pending rewards.
2. **Exploit:**  
   - The admin calls `rescueTokens(SYMM, 1500, adminAddress)`.
3. **Result:**  
   - All 1500 SYMM are transferred to the admin’s wallet.
   - User balances remain recorded as 1000 SYMM staked, but the contract holds 0 SYMM, causing subsequent withdrawals or claims to fail.

## Mitigation
- **Restrict Rescuable Tokens:** Modify `rescueTokens` to disallow withdrawals of the staking token and active reward tokens.
- **Update Internal Accounting:** Ensure that any withdrawal via rescueTokens adjusts related state variables (e.g., `pendingRewards`, user balances) accordingly.
- **Implement Governance Safeguards:** Require that admin actions, including token rescue, go through a timelock and multi-signature process to prevent unilateral abuse.
- **Input Validation:** Add checks to require that both the `token` and `receiver` addresses are non-zero.
