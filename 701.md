# Vesting plans cannot be resetted upon new addition of SYMM LP tokens

## Summary
If staker is adding liquidity for the 2nd or subsequent time, an unnecessary requirement check in _resetVestingPlans() can cause the function to fail, not allowing staker to add liquidity again.

## Vulnerability Details
Assume this scenario whereby Alice is adding liquidity for a second time. Hence, Alice has an existing vesting plan for SYMM LP token.

## POC
1. Alice invokes the `addLiquidity()` function in SYMMVesting.sol, specifying an amount of 40e18 SYMM tokens.
2. The `_addLiquidityProcess`() function is executed.
3. Unlocked SYMM tokens are obtained through claimUnlockedToken().
4. The `_addLiquidity()` function is called, which in turn calls `addLiquidityProportional()`, engaging with the Balancer pool.
5. For the sake of this scenario, let's assume that the function has transferred 20e18 worth of SYMM LP tokens to SymmVesting.sol.
6. As this is Alice's second instance of adding liquidity, let's assume her current unlocked tokens for her SYMM LP vesting plan total `30e18`, with locked tokens amounting to `5e18`.
7. The `_claimUnlockedToken()` function is invoked again to claim Alice's unlocked SYMM LP tokens, which total `30e18`.
8. amounts[0] is calculated as `lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount = 5e18 + 20e18 = 25e18`.
9. The `_resetVestingPlans()` function is called, passing `25e18` as the amounts parameter.
10. Within `_resetVestingPlans()`, since the amount of `25e18` is less than the unlocked amount of 30e18, the function will revert.

## Root Cause
Inaccurate validation for the amount being less than the unlocked tokens for SYMMLP tokens.

## Impact
Stakers who wish to add liquidity for the 2nd and subsequent times will revert, due to this unnecessary check. Even when stakers have enough locked SYMM LP tokens to be vested, they cannot proceed with liquidity addition as attempts to reset their SYMMLP vesting will revert.

## Mitigation
Consider not reverting for SYMMLP vesting plans as the check is only applicable for SYMM tokens.
