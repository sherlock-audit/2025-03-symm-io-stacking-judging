# Incorrect Decimal Scaling in USDC Calculation Will Cause Incorrect Fund Allocation

### Summary

An incorrect scaling operation in SymmVesting’s getLiquidityQuote function will cause an inaccurate USDC amount calculation for users as the contract will severely understate the required USDC due to an erroneous _mulDivUp adjustment, disrupting the liquidity-adding process.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L1C1-L261C2

In `SymmVesting.sol:getLiquidityQuote` the application of _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30) incorrectly scales down the initially correct usdcAmount, reducing it from a proper 6-decimal USDC value to a near-zero value, undermining the liquidity provision calculation.

```solidity
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```
Example:
symmAmount = 100e18 (100 SYMM, 18 decimals).

symmBalance = 1000e18 (1000 SYMM, 18 decimals).

usdcBalance = 500e6 (500 USDC, 6 decimals).

Computation: (100e18 * 500e6) / 1000e18 = 50,000e24 / 1000e18 = 50e6 (50 USDC).

Result: usdcAmount = 50e6, correctly in 6 decimals for USDC, reflecting the pool’s ratio (1 SYMM = 0.5 USDC).

```solidity
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```
Context: Applies _mulDivUp to adjust usdcAmount, but with inappropriate constants.

Definition of _mulDivUp:
```solidity
function _mulDivUp(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
    if (c == 0) revert ZeroDivision();
    uint256 product = a * b;
    assembly ("memory-safe") {
        result := mul(iszero(iszero(product)), add(div(sub(product, 1), c), 1))
    }
}
```
Computes ceil((a * b) / c).

Example:
a = usdcAmount = 50e6 (50 USDC).

b = 1e18 (18 decimals).

c = 1e30 (30 decimals).

Product: 50e6 * 1e18 = 50e24 (24 decimals).

Division: (50e24 - 1) / 1e30 ≈ 0 (integer division, < 1).

Ceiling: 0 + 1 = 1.

Result: usdcAmount = 1 (1 wei, not 1 USDC), losing 6 orders of magnitude from the original 50e6.

Problem: 
The scaling (1e18 / 1e30 = 1e-12) reduces usdcAmount by 12 decimals, far exceeding USDC’s 6-decimal requirement.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user provides symmAmount as input.

The contract calculates usdcAmount based on the incorrect scaling factor.

The contract executes the _mulDivUp function with the incorrect scaling values.

### External Pre-conditions

The SYMM/USDC token balances must be nonzero in the contract.

The transaction must pass any additional validation checks in the contract.

### Attack Path

A user initiates a transaction expecting a correct usdcAmount calculation.

The contract computes usdcAmount using the incorrect scaling factor.

The user receives a significantly smaller usdcAmount than intended.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate inability to add liquidity correctly, as the contract attempts to transfer an understated USDC amount (e.g., 1 wei instead of 50e6 USDC), likely causing the ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional call to revert due to insufficient USDC input, halting the liquidity provision process.
