# _disableInitializers isn't called for the constructors in the contracts deployed

### Summary

Every upgradable contract's implementation needs to have `_disableInitializers` code in the constructor such that an attacker cannot initialize the contract and use 

Although self destruct cannot reduce code size to zero anymore, It still leaves the implementation contract vulnerable  to validated contract address based phishing attacks on the end-user where the User thinks its a trusted address and interacts but will not be the case because of malicious instantiate data.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L17

Both the staking and vesting contracts have this bug, as they do not invoke `_disableInitializers` as is custom in upgradable contracts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

1. 

### Attack Path

1. 

### Impact

Protocol's validated contract address in etherscan can be used to phish users into thinking its a legit contract and not a malicious contract, however the initialize method can simply be taken over by attacker and phish user for funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

disable initializers in constructor for upgradable contracts
