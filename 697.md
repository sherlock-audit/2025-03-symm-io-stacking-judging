# Non-Compliance with EIP-1967 - Missing Beacon Implementation Function

### Summary

The choice to use a beacon proxy without implementing the required implementation() function is a mistake, as it prevents proxy contracts from retrieving the logic contract address, making upgrades impossible. This will cause centralized upgrade management failure for all proxy instances as the beacon contract will not be able to return the correct implementation.

### Root Cause

The choice to use a beacon proxy pattern is a mistake as the beacon contract does not implement the required function:
```solidity
function implementation() external view returns (address);
```
This function is mandatory for beacon contracts under EIP-1967 to return the logic contract address used by proxies. Without it, proxies cannot retrieve their implementation address, breaking the upgrade mechanism.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol deploys a proxy contract that points to a beacon.
2. The beacon contract does not implement the implementation() function.
3. The proxy contract relies on the beacon for retrieving the logic contract address.
4. An upgrade is attempted on the beacon.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol assumes compliance with EIP-1967 for upgrades.
2. Users interact with the proxy contract expecting correct functionality.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol deploys a beacon contract without the implementation() function.
2. A proxy contract is deployed that refers to the beacon for retrieving the implementation address.
3. An upgrade attempt occurs, but the proxy contract cannot fetch the updated implementation address.
4. The proxy contract becomes unusable since it cannot route calls to a valid implementation.

### Impact

The proxy contracts suffer a complete failure of upgradeability, making them non-functional after an upgrade attempt. As a result:
- Users cannot interact with the contract, leading to service disruption.
- The protocol loses control over upgrade management, requiring a redeployment.
- Potential financial losses if the contract is involved in fund management.
