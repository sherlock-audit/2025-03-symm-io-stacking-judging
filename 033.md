# [M-04] Vesting Progress Reset Issue

## Summary

The `resetAmount` function in LibVestingPlan.sol resets the vesting timeline by rebasing it from the current time, which can cause users to lose vesting progress and potentially extend their vesting period, leading to delayed access to tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In LibVestingPlan.sol:75-86, the `resetAmount` function contains logic that resets the vesting timeline:

Code reference: LibVestingPlan.sol#L75-L86 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L75-L86

```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    // Rebase the vesting plan from now.
    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    self.amount = amount;
    self.claimedAmount = 0;
    return self;
}
```

This function is called in several critical operations:

1. In Vesting.sol:232 during the `resetVestingPlans` function:
```solidity
vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
```

2. In Vesting.sol:287 during the `_claimLockedToken` function:
```solidity
vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
```

3. In SymmVesting.sol:141 during the `swapLockedForLp` function:
```solidity
symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);
```

The issue is that when `resetAmount` is called, it resets both the `startTime` and `endTime` of the vesting plan. While it preserves the remaining duration (`remaining = remainingDuration(self)`), it resets the vesting progress by setting `startTime = block.timestamp` and `endTime = block.timestamp + remaining`. This means that any progress a user has made in their vesting schedule is lost, and they effectively start a new vesting period from the current time.

For users who have been vesting for a significant period, this reset can extend their overall vesting timeline and delay access to their tokens.

## Impact

The impact of this issue includes:

1. **Extended Vesting Periods**: Users who have made significant progress in their vesting schedule may find their progress reset, effectively extending the time until they can fully access their tokens.

2. **Unexpected Token Lockup**: Users may expect tokens to be available at a certain date based on the original vesting schedule, but after a reset, those tokens remain locked for longer.

3. **Reduced User Trust**: Unexpected changes to vesting schedules can erode user trust in the platform.

4. **Potential Economic Loss**: Delayed access to tokens can result in opportunity costs or economic losses for users who planned financial activities around the expected vesting schedule.

This issue affects multiple core functions in the protocol, including locked token claims and LP token swaps, making it a significant concern for users interacting with these features.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// LibVestingPlan.sol:75-86
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    // Rebase the vesting plan from now.
    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    self.amount = amount;
    self.claimedAmount = 0;
    return self;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `resetAmount` function to preserve the original vesting timeline while adjusting the amount. This can be done by:

1. Maintaining the original `startTime` instead of resetting it to the current time.
2. Calculating the new `endTime` based on the original timeline and the proportion of tokens remaining.

Here's a suggested implementation:

```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    
    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    
    // Keep the original startTime
    // Only adjust the amount and claimedAmount
    self.amount = amount;
    self.claimedAmount = 0;
    
    return self;
}
```

Alternatively, if rebasing is intentional, clearly document this behavior and consider adding a parameter to allow users to opt-out of timeline resets when appropriate.
