# Malicious governance changes will permanently lock unclaimed rewards for stakers

### Summary

The removal of a reward token from the rewardTokens array when it is unwhitelisted will cause unclaimed rewards for that token to become unclaimable. This vulnerability will cause a permanent loss of rewards for stakers as an attacker or malicious admin will remove a token from the whitelist, preventing users from claiming their pending rewards.



### Root Cause

In case it’s a mistake in the code: In SymmStaking.sol the `configureRewardToken` function, when setting a token’s whitelist status to false, immediately removes it from the rewardTokens array without preserving pending rewards.
Example: – In SymmStaking.sol, when a token is unwhitelisted, it is removed from the rewardTokens array even if `pendingRewards[token]` is nonzero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An admin or attacker calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to unwhitelist a reward token.
2. The token to be unwhitelisted has pending, unclaimed rewards recorded.
3. The contract does not provide a mechanism to claim or transfer rewards for tokens that are removed from the whitelist.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Governance (or an attacker in a compromised scenario) intentionally or maliciously unwhitelists a reward token.
2. Market participants assume that only whitelisted tokens will ever be rewarded and do not claim rewards in time.

### Attack Path

1. The admin (or attacker) calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` on a token that has unclaimed rewards.
2. The function removes the token from the `rewardTokens` array.
3. As a result, the contract no longer processes rewards for that token.
4. Users with pending rewards for that token are now unable to claim their rewards, leaving them permanently locked.

### Impact

Stakers or reward recipients suffer a loss of pending rewards, which reduces their overall yield and undermines trust in the reward mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One mitigation is to preserve unclaimed rewards when unwhitelisting a token. For example, the contract could transfer any pending rewards to a dedicated claimable pool or require that all pending rewards be claimed before unwhitelisting.
