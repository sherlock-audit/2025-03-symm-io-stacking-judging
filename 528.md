# Admin will lock reward funds for stakers

# Admin will lock reward funds for stakers

## Summary
The failure to handle pending rewards during reward token removal will cause a loss of claimable rewards for stakers, as an admin will remove the token mid-distribution, leaving user rewards locked in the contract.

## Root case
In the SymmStaking contract https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312, removing a reward token from the whitelist via `configureRewardToken(token, false)` does not distribute any pending rewards. As a result, rewards already accrued remain in the contract but are no longer claimable because the claim functions only process tokens still in the whitelist.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. **Admin Action:** An admin calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to remove a reward token.
2. **Pending Rewards Exist:** The token has a non-zero `pendingRewards[token]` balance (possibly below a threshold, e.g. â‰¤10).
3. **Claim Logic Dependence:** The reward claim functions iterate only over whitelisted tokens, ignoring removed tokens.

## External Pre-conditions
1. **User Rewards Unclaimed:** Users have accumulated rewards for the token but have not claimed them.
2. **Premature Removal:** The admin removes the token while rewards are still pending.

## Attack path
1. The admin funds rewards and users accrue reward balances.
2. The admin calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)`, removing the token from the whitelist.
3. The contract ceases to update and distribute rewards for the removed token.
4. When users call `claimRewards()`, the removed token is skipped, leaving pending rewards unclaimed.
5. The only recovery path is through an admin rescue operation.

## Impact
Stakers lose access to their accrued rewards for the removed token, as those funds remain locked in the contract. This not only causes a direct loss of expected yield but also undermines trust in the protocol.

## PoC
1. The admin funds the contract with a reward token (TKN) and initiates a reward period.
2. Users accrue rewards, leaving, for example, 5 TKN unclaimed.
3. The admin calls `configureRewardToken(TKN, false)` to remove TKN from the whitelist.
4. When a user calls `claimRewards()`, TKN is omitted from the payout despite `pendingRewards[TKN]` showing 5.
5. The 5 TKN remain locked in the contract, accessible only via an admin rescue call.

## Mitigation
- **Enforce Strict Removal Conditions:** Require that `pendingRewards[token] == 0` before allowing a reward token to be removed from the whitelist.
- **Force Distribution:** Ensure that all pending rewards are distributed (or claimed) before removal.
- **Preserve Claim Logic:** Update the claim functions to continue processing tokens marked for removal until all pending rewards are disbursed.
