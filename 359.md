# Last DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder can renounce role and permanently brick role management functionality

### Summary

The contracts fail to implement any protection against the renunciation of the last DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder, which will permanently brick administrative role management functionality as no new roles can ever be granted once all admin roles are revoked.

### Root Cause

In `SymmAllocationClaimer.sol:` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L12-L64 
`SymmStaking.sol:` -  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L17-L343
`Vesting.sol:` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L13-L86
`Symmio.sol:` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/token/symm.sol#L11-L20

There is no protection against the last DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder renouncing their role, which would permanently disable the ability to grant new roles.

The OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementation allows any role holder to renounce their role, even if they are the last admin, but doesn't provide built-in protection against this scenario.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is granted to at least one address in each contract
2. The last address with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE renounces its role


### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. The last DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder calls `renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, self)`
2. The OpenZeppelin AccessControl.renounceRole function executes without any checks on whether this is the last admin
3. No addresses hold the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE anymore
4. All future attempts to call grantRole or revokeRole for any roles will fail

### Impact

The protocol permanently loses the ability to manage roles, which breaks core administrative functionality:

1. In `SymmAllocationClaimer`:
    - New SETTER_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, or UNPAUSER_ROLE holders cannot be added
    - If any existing role holder's key is compromised, that role cannot be revoked
    - If the contract needs to be paused in an emergency but the PAUSER_ROLE holder is unavailable, no new PAUSER_ROLE can be granted
2. In `SymmStaking`:
    - The `rescueTokens` function (onlyRole DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) becomes permanently unavailable if needed in an emergency
    - No new REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, or UNPAUSER_ROLE can be assigned
    - In the event a malicious actor gains REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE, this access cannot be revoked
3. In `Vesting`: 
    - Multiple critical role-restricted functions become permanently unavailable for new assignees
    - Any compromised roles (SETTER_ROLE, OPERATOR_ROLE, etc.) cannot be revoked
4. In `Symmio`: 
    - No new MINTER_ROLE holders can be granted
    - If the protocol needs to change the minting authority, it cannot do so


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a protection mechanism by overriding the `renounceRole` function to prevent renouncing the last admin role:

This ensures that there is always at least one address with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, maintaining the ability to manage roles throughout the contract's lifecycle.
