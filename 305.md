# Penalty Redistribution Not Enforced in Early Unlock Claims

## Summary
The [SymmVesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol) contract collects a `50%` penalty on early token unlocks but lacks a mechanism to redistribute these penalties to other stakers as specified in the protocol documentation.

Penalties are sent to a static address `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` without further distribution logic.

## Vulnerability Description
When users claim locked tokens early, `50%` of the claimed amount is deducted as a penalty and transferred to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`. However, the protocolâ€™s tokenomics specify that `80%` of penalties should go to non-unlocking stakers and `20%` to ecosystem incentives.

The current implementation centralizes penalties in a single address, creating a risk of fund misappropriation and violating the protocol economic model.

```solidity
/// @notice Internal function to claim locked tokens.
	/// @param token Address of the token.
	/// @param user Address of the user.
	/// @param amount Amount of locked tokens to claim.
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
```

## Likelihood
The admin sets themselves as `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.  Users claim early unlocks, incurring a `50%` penalty. The admin keeps the entire penalty instead of redistributing it.

## Impact 
Penalties could be siphoned off instead of being redistributed. Stakers lose promised redistributions, reducing incentives to participate.

## Proof of Concept
1. Admin configures `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` as their wallet address.
2. UserA calls `claimLockedToken(100 SYMM)`
3. Transfers `50 SYMM` to `UserA`.
4. Transfers `50 SYMM` to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.
5. This address retains `50 SYMM` instead of redistributing. The redistributing never occurs.

## Recommendations
Enforce an automatic redistribution mechanism in `_claimLockedToken()`. Or, implement a governance-controlled distribution mechanism.
