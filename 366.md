# Incorrect reward calculation for tokens with different decimals in SymmStaking::rewardPerToken and SymmStaking::earned

### Summary

The incorrect assumption that all reward tokens have 18 decimals in the reward calculation logic in [`rewardPerToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194) and [`earned`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210)will cause incorrect reward distribution for stakers and the protocol. Specifically, users staking for low-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals) will receive significantly fewer rewards than intended, while if high-decimal tokens are added, the protocol may overpay rewards. This happens because the reward calculation functions use a fixed `1e18` divisor, causing misalignment in decimal precision.

### Root Cause

In [`SymmStaking.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol), the contract assumes all reward tokens have 18 decimals by dividing reward calculations using `1e18`.  
This incorrect assumption leads to misallocation of rewards when distributing tokens with different decimal values.

- In [`earned`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210) function
  ```solidity
  function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
      return
          ((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
          rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
  }
  ```
  - The `1e18` divisor assumes all reward tokens have 18 decimals.
  - USDC/USDT (6 decimals): Users receive 1/1e12 of the expected rewards.
  - Tokens with more than 18 decimals (if introduced) will cause overpayment.

- In [`rewardPerToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194) function 
  ```solidity
  function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
      if (totalSupply == 0) {
          return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
      }
      return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
          (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) *
              rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply);
  }
  ```
  - This function also assumes all reward tokens have 18 decimals when performing calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract distributes rewards to users based on the `earned` function.
2. The contract assumes all tokens have 18 decimals when performing calculations.
3. Users stake SYMM tokens and expect rewards in multiple whitelisted tokens (e.g., USDC, USDT).
4. Total rewards distributed are determined by `rewardPerToken`, which is also based on `1e18`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users stake their tokens expecting to receive stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDC, USDT).
2. The protocol integrates multiple reward tokens with varying decimals.
3. The contract does not adjust reward calculations dynamically based on token decimals.

### Attack Path

1. A user stakes SYMM tokens, expecting rewards in a stablecoin such as USDC (6 decimals).
2. The `earned` function divides by `1e18`, assuming the reward token has 18 decimals.
3. Since USDC only has 6 decimals, the user effectively receives 1/1e12 (one trillionth) of their rightful rewards.
4. The user receives severely reduced staking rewards, leading to financial losses.
5. Alternatively, if a high-decimal token (e.g., 24 decimals) were introduced, users could exploit the incorrect calculation to receive excess rewards.

### Impact

- Stakers receiving rewards in tokens with fewer than 18 decimals (e.g., USDC, USDT).  
- Users receive 1/1e12 (one trillionth) of expected rewards, leading to over 99.9999999% loss in staking rewards.  
- If a high-decimal token is introduced, the protocol overpays rewards, leading to financial losses.  
- Attackers could potentially exploit this by requesting rewards in high-decimal tokens (if added in the future) to receive excess rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Instead of assuming 18 decimals, dynamically fetch each reward tokenâ€™s decimals using the ERC-20 `decimals()` function:
    ```solidity
    uint8 decimals = IERC20(rewardsToken).decimals();
    uint256 precisionFactor = 10decimals;
    ```
    Then, adjust the calculation:
    ```solidity
    return
        ((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account].[rewardsToken])) / precisionFactor) +
    rewards[account][rewardsToken];
    ```
- Convert low-decimal rewards to a standardized 18-decimal format before calculations.
