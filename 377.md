# Distribution prevention on low-decimals reward tokens

### Summary

The staking contract allows users to deposit and withdraw staking(SYMM) tokens (18 decimals), adjusting `totalSupply` and individual balances accordingly. Stakers receive rewards in whitelisted tokens such as `USDC`, `USDT`, `USDE`, which are distributed via the `notifyRewardAmount` function. However, there is an issue in the `rewardPerToken` function when dealing with reward tokens that have lower decimals (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals).

As totalSupply is denominated in 18-decimal SYMM tokens, while rewards are in lower-decimal tokens, a frequent market with many users interacting with the contract (depositing/withdrawing) can cause `rewardPerToken` updates to resolve to zero. This happens because the time gap between updates is small, and the calculation rounds down due to Solidityâ€™s integer division, effectively preventing users from claiming their rewards.

### Root Cause

The rewardPerToken calculation is performed using the formula:

```solidity
(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply)
```
Where:
1. `rewardRate` is the rate at which rewards are distributed.
2. `totalSupply` represents the total amount of SYMM tokens staked.
3. `1e18` is used to scale up the calculation for precision.
Since totalSupply is in 18 decimals and reward tokens like USDC have only 6 decimals, frequent updates combined with high totalSupply result in rewardPerToken continuously rounding down to zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract has a large `totalSupply` of 18-decimal SYMM tokens.
2. `notifyRewardAmount` is called, distributing rewards in low-decimal tokens like USDC (6 decimals).
3. Users interact frequently with the contract (depositing/withdrawing), causing `rewardPerToken` to update often.
4. The contract is deployed on Base L2, where gas fees are low, making frequent updates feasible and inexpensive.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A whitelisted reward token with 6 decimals (e.g., USDC) is added, and `notifyRewardAmount` is called to distribute rewards.

2. The rewardRate is calculated as:

```solidity
rewardRate = amount / duration;
```
Since rewardAmount is denominated in a 6-decimal token, rewardRate is relatively small.

3. Staking contract has a large amount of SYMM tokens (e.g., 100_000e18).

4. An attacker maliciously calls deposit/withdraw frequently to update `lastUpdateTime`, reducing the time difference in `rewardPerToken` calculations. Since the contract is on Base L2, this attack is cheap to execute and can be sustained over an extended period (e.g., a full staking week).

5. In a frequent market, even without an attacker, normal user interactions will constantly trigger `rewardPerToken` updates due to organic staking/unstaking.

6. When rewardPerToken is computed:

```solidity
((timeElapsed * rewardRate * 1e18) / totalSupply)
```
Given:

- `rewardRate` is small due to the 6-decimal reward token.
- `totalSupply` is large in 18 decimals.
 - `timeElapsed` is very small due to frequent updates.
The result is rounded down to 0 due to integer division.

7. Since `rewardPerToken` remains 0, users are unable to accumulate claimable rewards, effectively making rewards unclaimable.

### Impact

All stakers are unable to claim rewards in USDC, USDT, or any low-decimal whitelisted token.

### PoC

Here is a PoC showcasing the issue, the only required step to run this PoC is to create a mock ERC20 token with lower decimals(6).

```solidity
		it("reward per token usdc 0", async function () {
			const stakedAmount = ethers.parseEther("100000"); // 100_000 SYMM tokens (18 decimals)
			// initialize the reward amount as 10_000 USDC
			const rewardAmount = ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6); // 10_000 USDC tokens (6 decimals)

			// mint to user1 the staked amount so he can fill the totalSupply up to 100_000 staking tokens
			await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user1.address, stakedAmount)

			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), stakedAmount);
			await myUsdcToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			// whitelist the usdc token as reward token
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await myUsdcToken.getAddress(), true);
			// add 10_000 USDC as reward into the staking contract
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await myUsdcToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])
			
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), stakedAmount)
			// make the user1 deposit 100_000 staking tokens (100_000 SYMM tokens) so the totalSupply is 100_000
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(stakedAmount, user1.address)

			// at this point, the totalSupply should be equal to the stakedAmount
			// and the rewardPerToken should be 0
			expect(await symmStaking.totalSupply()).to.equal(stakedAmount);
			expect(await symmStaking.balanceOf(user1.address)).to.equal(stakedAmount);
			expect(await symmStaking.rewardPerToken(await myUsdcToken.getAddress())).to.equal(0);
			
			// increase the time by 4 seconds (2 seconds is the time Base needs to mint a new block)
			ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [4]);
			ethers.provider.send("evm_mine");

			// rewardRate is 0
			console.log("rewardRate USDC", await symmStaking.rewardState(myUsdcToken.getAddress()));
			
			// user1 tries to claim rewards
			// since the gap between the last update and the current time is 2 blocks (4 seconds)
			// the rewardPerToken gets rounded down to zero and user claims 0 USDC
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards();
			expect(await myUsdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)).to.equal(0);
		})
```

### Mitigation

Possible mitigation in this case is to use higher scaling factor(for example e24) in `rewardPerToken` calculation.
