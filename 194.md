# None of the reward tokens can be claimed if the staker is blacklisted for at least one of the reward tokens

### Summary

If a staker is blacklisted by USDC (or any other token with blacklist), he will not be able to claim non-USDC rewards as well, because `_claimRewardsFor` attempts to iterate through all reward tokens and transfer all of them to the staker in one transaction.

### Root Cause

Reward tokens can only be transferred all at once.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Staker is blacklisted for one of the reward tokens

### Attack Path

1. Staker stakes
2. Rewards are added for USDC, USDT, USDE
3. Staker is blacklisted by USDC for whatever reason
4. Staker can not claim USDT and USDE rewards (as well as USDC)

### Impact

Loss of all rewards for the staker, even for tokens he was not blacklisted by.

### Mitigation

Use try/catch for transfer of reward tokens; or allow users to claim specific tokens, instead of sending all tokens in one transaction.
