# Improper ERC20 Transfer Handling in `Vesting._claimLockedToken()` will Permanently Trap User USDT Funds

### Summary

The use of standard ERC20 `transfer()` method in function `Vesting._claimLockedToken()` will cause permanent loss of funds for users when non-compliant ERC20 token fails silently during claims, while USDT is explicitly included in the protocol as to the documentation. This creates an irreversible state where claimed tokens remain stuck in the contract after failed transfers, while user record get updated as transfer succeeds. The impact is permanent fund loss for users attempting to claim locked USDT, as the protocol provides no recovery mechanism for failed transfers.  

### Root Cause

In function [`Vesting._claimLockedToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L295-L296), the use of standard ERC20 `transfer()` method creates compatibility issues with USDT, which is explicitly whitelisted in the protocol but is non-compliant ERC20 token that could cause silent transfer failure. The protocol implementation should use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer()` method, which properly handles both compliant and non-compliant tokens through low-level calls and return value validation. 

```solidity
contract Vesting is
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
    function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

        // Adjust the vesting plan
@>      vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
        totalVested[token] -= amount;
        uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

        // Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
        _ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

@>      IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
@>      IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

        emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
    }
}

// Audit Readme
Only whitelisted tokens can work with the codebase, and these include stable-coins such as USDC, USDT, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Protocol whitelists USDT** as per documentation stating "stable-coins such as USDC, USDT [...] can work with the codebase"
2. **User attempts to claim locked USDT tokens** through `Vesting._claimLockedToken()` function
3. **Non-compliant USDT transfer fails silently** when using standard ERC20 `transfer()` method that cannot handle non-compliant ERC20 token
4. **Contract state updates despite failed transfer** by marking tokens as claimed in `vestingPlan.resetAmount()`

### Impact

The affected users suffer permanent loss of their vested USDT tokens. When the non-compliant transfer fails, the contract:
- Updates internal accounting (marks tokens as claimed)
- Fails to actually transfer tokens to user
- Leaves no way to recover the unclaimed tokens

This creates an irreversible state where the protocol considers tokens successfully transferred while they remain stuck in the contract, with no mechanism for users to reclaim them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace standard ERC20 `transfer()` method with OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer()` method for ERC20 token transfers:

```diff
-	  IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
+	  IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
-         IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
+	  IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```
