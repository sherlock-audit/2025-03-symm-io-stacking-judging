# Malicious reward notifications will dilute rewards for stakers

### Summary

The recalculation of reward rates over the full duration when new rewards are added during an ongoing reward period will cause an unexpected extension of the periodFinish timestamp, diluting the reward distribution for stakers. This vulnerability will impact stakers because an attacker or misconfigured admin can trigger reward notifications that effectively spread rewards over a longer period than intended, reducing the per-second reward rate.


### Root Cause

In case it’s a conceptual mistake: The choice to recalculate the reward rate over the full duration when new rewards are added during an ongoing period is a mistake as it resets the periodFinish to block.timestamp + duration rather than using the remaining time in the current period.
Example: – In SymmStaking.sol, `_addRewardsForToken` resets `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration` even if there is an ongoing reward period with remaining time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There is an ongoing reward period for a reward token.
2. New rewards are added via `notifyRewardAmount` during this period.
3. The function `_addRewardsForToken` recalculates the reward rate using the full duration.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions trigger frequent reward notifications.
2. Governance or an admin adjusts reward amounts during an active period.




### Attack Path

1. The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with additional rewards during an active reward period.
2. The contract recalculates the reward rate over a new full duration, thereby extending `periodFinish` beyond the originally intended end time.
3. This dilutes the reward rate because the same rewards are now spread over a longer period.
4. Stakers receive a lower per-second reward rate than expected.

### Impact

Stakers suffer reduced reward earnings over time, which could diminish participation in the staking program and erode user trust in the reward mechanism.




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A mitigation is to modify the reward notification logic so that new rewards are added to the remaining period rather than resetting the period finish. For example, calculate the new reward rate using the remaining time (i.e. `periodFinish - block.timestamp`) and add the new rewards to the pending amount.
