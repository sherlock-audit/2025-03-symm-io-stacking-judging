# User might get incorrect rate when the balancer pool is in recovery mode

### Summary

The protocol allows users to convert their SYMM tokens to balancer pool tokens by providing extra USDC.

The amount of USDC to add and the LP amount is calculated in `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote`:

```solidity
    function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
        uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
        uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
        uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
        uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1]; 

        usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
        usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
        lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
    }
```

It fetches the live balances and calculates the proportional amount of USDC needed and the LP tokens that will be needed.

However, [POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/40b4cd30889103dd17c0d87bc7d3d397823b65a0/pkg/interfaces/contracts/pool-utils/IPoolInfo.sol#L37-L45), will return incorrect amounts in situations when the pool is in recovery mode, since recovery withdrawals do not update the balances, this could cause the actual balances and rate in the pool to differ than the one calculated, which would cause the users to deposit on unfavorable rate.

The pool stays out of sync until recovery mode is disabled, which is when the balances are synced and the pool can operate normally.


### Root Cause

Balancer pool does not update live balances when in recovery mode.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. Balancer pool enters recovery mode

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users will have LP tokens and amounts calculated on out of sync balances and could cause them to deposit at incorrect rate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider reverting when the pool is in recovery mode
