# Use of initializer modifier instead of onlyInitializing in Vesting.sol will cause reverts for more than one SymmVesting deployments

## Description
- Inside `Vesting.sol`, function `__vesting_init()` uses the [`initializer` modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76) instead of `onlyInitializing`.
- It is then inherited by `SymmVesting.sol` and its `initialize()` [calls `__vesting_init()` internally](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L77).
- The structure of params in `initialize()` in `SymmVesting.sol` shows that there could be multiple deployments of this contract (for example different POOLs or ROUTERs or VAULTs etc) OR there could be other contracts which could also inherit `Vesting.sol`. In either case, the call to `__vesting_init()` will revert since it is protected by the `initializer` modifier and can be called only once. 
- [OpenZeppelin recommmends](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/writing-upgradeable#initializers) using the `onlyInitializing` modifier for parent contracts so that inheritance structure can be correctly deployed:
> Note that the `initializer` modifier can only be called once even when using inheritance, so parent contracts should use the `onlyInitializing` modifier

## Impact
No other child contract can be deployed which inherits from `Vesting.sol`.

## Mitigation
Use `onlyInitializing` modifier in `__vesting_init()`.
