# A malicious user can extend the staking duration forever

### Summary

Missing access control for the `notifyRewardAmount` function allows every user to add new rewards, which extends the staking duration. 

### Root Cause

The `notifyRewardAmount` function is missing a check on who can add a new reward. The only requirement is that the tokens are in the allowlist.

```solidity
if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);
```

Every time a new reward is added, the reward rate changes, lastUpdated is set to `block.timestamp`, and periodFinish is extended by the duration (1 week). [SymmStaking.sol#L378](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378)

```solidity
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;

			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; // 1 week duration
		}
		
		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration; //@audit add 1 week
```

This means if there's an ongoing reward duration and its halfway done, adding new rewards will automatically increase the reward duration by the initial time period. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

The malicious user can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function every 30 minutes by adding a very small reward (amount = 1), only paying the gas fee. The contract will be deployed on the Base network, so the cost of this attack will be ~$0.01 - $0.03 per call, or $0.48 - $0.60 per day (30 calls * 48 times = $0.48) to extend the duration by 1 day.

### External Pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

1. The malicious user can call the notifyRewardAmount function every 30 minutes by adding a very small reward.
2. The staking period is extended by 30 minutes with every call.

The dev team can not prevent this attack because any address can call the `notifyRewardAmount` function.

### Impact

This issue can lead to the reward duration being extended beyond the intended time period, causing rewards to be distributed over a longer duration than initially planned. As a result, users may receive smaller rewards over time, which might not align with the project's goals or user expectations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an access check to ensure that the `notifyRewardAmount` function can only be called by the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`.
