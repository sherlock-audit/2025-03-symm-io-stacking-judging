# rescuing tokens does not update the state

### Summary

The admins of` SymStaking.sol `have the ability to rescue tokens. In case those tokens are the staking token or the reward token, the state is not properly updated.


### Root Cause

States like` totalSupply, rewards, pendingRewards` are tracked inside SymStaking.sol. However those variables are not updated when an admin tries to rescue such funds.

This leads to wrong states such as wrong number of staked tokens(in case an admin tries to rescue staked tokens), since totalSupply is not updated. The situation is the same for the reward tokens, except their own state vars are not updated properly in `rescueTokens()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) Users have staked tokens
2) Rewards are ready to be claimed
3) an admin calls` rescueTokens()` with tokens

### External Pre-conditions

-no

### Attack Path

1) Users have staked tokens
2) Rewards are ready to be claimed
3) an admin calls` rescueTokens()` with tokens that are supported
4) all the corresponding reward tokens state vars are not updated inside SymmStaking.sol

### Impact

State inconsistency for all rescued tokens, potential missmatch when calculating the rewards, user staked amounts etc
