# Attacker can call SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount to extend periodFinish and "dilute" rewards

### Summary

`notifyRewardAmount` is a function responsible for increasing pending rewards, adjusting the rate, and updating `periodFinish` as long as the caller provides the amount of tokens to distribute. The issue arises because a **user can indefinitely extend the periodFinish by contributing a minimal amount of rewards**, and since the function is permissionless, any attacker can call it.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

In the case where `periodFinish` has not yet finished, the user **can always add** `state.duration` **to** `periodFinish` **by contributing a minimal amount of rewards (1 wei)**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. isRewardToken[token] := true

2. block.timestamp < state.periodFinish

### External Pre-conditions

*No Response*

### Attack Path

An example scenario would be as follows:

* Duration is 1 week.

* Users have already claimed 50% of the total rewards (3.5 days remaining).

1. The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount, contributing 1 wei of the token in question.
2. At this point, the remaining days go back to 7 days, thus diluting the reward rate.

* The attacker can calculate the correct intervals to cause more disruption to users.

### Impact

* Indefinite extension of the time needed to receive the full rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Depending on the developers' perspective, solutions could include adding access control to `notifyRewardAmount` or, instead of using `state.duration`, use `state.remaining` **to calculate the new rate and periodFinish**.
