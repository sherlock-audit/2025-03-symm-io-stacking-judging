# User can always change the future vesting.startTime to block.timestamp

### Summary

The SETTER_ROLE setup the vesting plans for the users by providing the startTime and endTime by calling `function setupVestingPlans(token,startTime,endTime,users,amount)` .

But startTime can easily be manipulated to change to block.timestamp by the users by calling calimlockedTokens(token,amount) instantly by passing amount =1. And he can continue claiming from the vesting even before the startTime.




### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L299

Here the vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount); will be called where amount = 1.
 This will change the self.starttime to block.timestamp .

```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		....
	=>	self.startTime = block.timestamp;
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
		self.amount = amount;
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}
```

The loss for user is 1 token,

### Internal Pre-conditions

SETTER_ROLE sets a vesting plan that starts in the future.

### External Pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path

User calls claimLockedToken(token , amonut) instantly after the vestingPLan has been set. by proving amount = 1 for minimum loss

### Impact

User can claim the vestedTokens prematurely with the cost of only 1 token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a minAmount Parameter while claiming locked tokens.
