# POOL Token Mismatch Causes Fund Locking

### Summary

Incorrect POOL token configuration traps SYMM/USDC during liquidity provision.

### Root Cause

The contract assumes POOL tokens are SYMM/USDC but does not validate them during initialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. POOL is initialized with non-SYMM/USDC tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Admin configures the POOL incorrectly.

### Attack Path

Admin initializes `POOL` with invalid tokens.
Users call `addLiquidity`, but token swaps fail.
SYMM/USDC sent to the contract are locked.
