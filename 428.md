# We would not be able to restake the LP tokens (symmio/usdc) if their total is less than the unlocked amount

### Summary

We will not be able to restake the LP tokens if their total is less than the unlocked amount due to the if condition [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231).

This will cause the users to earn less in rewards and this is considered broken functionality as well

### Root Cause

An overly validated function, specifically the if condition that I highlighted is the root cause.

We should be able to reset the vesting plan, even though we've unlocked more than the amount we wanna reset.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Unlocked amount must be bigger than the `amount` variable it is compared to

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice has a vesting plan of 10 days and claims on the 8th day the unlocked amount 
2. Alice then wants to restake her LP tokens, but founds out that she can't due to the overly restrictive function

### Impact

Broken functionality as she should be able to reset her vesting plan

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

_No response_
