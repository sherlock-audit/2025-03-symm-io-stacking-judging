# Public setup() Function in Library Allows Unauthorized Vesting Plan Creation

### Summary

The setup() function in the VestingPlanOps library is public, which means any contract that imports this library can call it. This allows unauthorized actors to arbitrarily create vesting plans, potentially leading to:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L57
- Creating new vesting schedules for accounts they do not control.
- Locking or stealing funds by creating vesting terms.

This vulnerability breaks access control and can result in unauthorized modifications of token distributions.

### Root Cause

setup() is Public in the Library:
Since it's public, any contract that imports VestingPlanOps can call setup(), creating vesting plans without permission.


### Internal Pre-conditions

NONE

### External Pre-conditions

NONE

### Attack Path

Attacker deploys a contract that imports VestingPlanOps.
Attacker calls setup().


### Impact

Unauthorized creating of vesting plans.
Attackers could lock tokens permanently or steal vesting allocations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change setup() from public to internal
Before:
`function setup(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {`
After:
`function setup(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) internal returns (VestingPlan storage) {`
