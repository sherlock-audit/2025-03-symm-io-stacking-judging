# Time-Weighted Reward Inconsistency Allows Unfair Distribution for Early Depositors

### Summary

A flaw in the reward distribution mechanism causes rewards to be calculated only from the point when notifyRewardAmount is called, ignoring the deposit time of earlier stakers. This design leads to an unfair scenario where users who deposited tokens before the reward notification are treated the same as those who deposited afterward, diluting the rewards for early depositors.

### Root Cause

In the current implementation, the reward calculation only begins accruing from the moment notifyRewardAmount is called. As a result, the staking duration is measured solely from that point forward, rather than from each user's deposit time. This means that if a user deposits tokens well before the reward period is notified, the time during which their tokens have been staked is not reflected in the reward calculation.

Example:

User1 deposits tokens significantly earlier than the reward notification, while User3 deposits tokens immediately after.
Both users eventually have their rewards computed based solely on the time elapsed after the reward notification, leading to equal reward accrual for both—even though User1 has staked for a longer duration overall.

### Internal Pre-conditions


User1 and User2 deposit tokens before the reward period is notified.
The reward notification (via notifyRewardAmount) resets the reward accrual period.
User3 deposits tokens after the notification, starting their accrual from that point.

### External Pre-conditions


The reward duration and rate are fixed when notifyRewardAmount is called.
No adjustments (e.g., emergency actions) interfere with the reward calculation during the period.

### Attack Path


User1 deposits tokens at time T₀, and User2 deposits tokens at the same time.
After a significant period (e.g., 100 days), an admin calls notifyRewardAmount, resetting the reward start time to T₁.
User3 deposits tokens at T₁, the same time as the reward period begins.
Despite User1’s earlier deposit, both User1 and User3 earn rewards based solely on the time from T₁ onward, leading to identical reward calculations even though User1’s tokens were staked longer.

### Impact


Diluted Rewards for Early Depositors: Early stakers (e.g., User1) receive lower rewards relative to their actual staking duration, as their earlier deposit time is disregarded.
Incentive Misalignment: The protocol fails to incentivize early and long-term participation since deposit time is not accurately factored into reward calculations.
Economic Imbalance: The misallocation of rewards can lead to systemic discrepancies in the protocol’s incentive structure, potentially reducing overall user participation and trust.

### Mitigation


Time-Weighted Reward Calculation: Modify the reward calculation mechanism so that each user’s reward accrual starts from the actual deposit time rather than the notifyRewardAmount call.
Checkpointing Deposits: Implement a system where the deposit time is recorded as a checkpoint, ensuring that the reward calculation factors in the full duration that tokens have been staked.
Update Reward Formula: Adjust the reward distribution formula to weigh rewards based on both the deposit amount and the duration for which tokens have been staked relative to the reward notification timestamp.
Comprehensive Testing: Develop unit tests that simulate deposits at varying times relative to reward notifications to ensure that early depositors receive appropriately higher rewards.
By addressing these mitigations, the protocol can ensure fairer reward distribution that truly reflects both the amount and the duration of staked tokens.
