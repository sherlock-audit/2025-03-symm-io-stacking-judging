# Missing Access Control in notifyRewardAmount

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function is designed to deposit reward tokens into the contract for distribution among stakers, but it lacks proper access control mechanisms. As a result, any external account can invoke this function to notify and inject rewards, which could lead to significant manipulation of the reward distribution process and potential financial harm to stakers.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the absence of an appropriate access control modifier in the `notifyRewardAmount` function. The function is declared as:

     function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external 
     nonReentrant whenNotPaused { ... }

No role-based restriction (e.g., onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) or onlyOwner) is enforced, leaving the function accessible to any external account when the contract is not paused.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  Whitelisted Reward Tokens:
The function assumes that every token in the provided tokens array is whitelisted. Although it performs a check `(if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);)`, an attacker can use tokens that are already approved.
2.  Proper Reward Calculation Logic:
The contract logic depends on accurate updating of global reward states via `_updateRewardsStates(address(0))` and internal functions like `_addRewardsForToken`. If these are working as intended, the issue remains solely in the function’s unrestricted access.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  Public Accessibility:
The function is declared external and is guarded only by `nonReentrant` and `whenNotPaused` modifiers. There is no external requirement (e.g., role-based restriction) to call the function.
2.  Contract Not Paused:
If the contract is not paused (i.e., `whenNotPaused` passes), then any account may call this function.


### Attack Path

1.	Discovery:
An attacker identifies that the `notifyRewardAmount` function is publicly accessible due to the lack of access control.
2.	Preparation:
The attacker compiles a list of valid reward tokens (or manipulates token whitelist status) and prepares inflated reward amounts.
3.	Execution:
The attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with carefully crafted token and amount arrays. For example:

          notifyRewardAmount([TokenA, TokenB], [1000000, 500000]);

The function processes the call, transferring reward tokens from the attacker’s account to the contract, updating `pendingRewards`, and adjusting internal reward parameters.
4.	Result:
The global reward state is manipulated with unauthorized reward deposits, skewing future reward calculations and potentially enabling the attacker or colluding parties to claim excessive rewards.
5.	Exploitation:
This attack can lead to exploitation, such as draining reward pool or diluting rewards for legitimate stakers.


### Impact

Reward Manipulation: Unauthorized actors can add arbitrary reward amounts, skewing the distribution mechanism and causing misallocation of rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict `notifyRewardAmount` to only authorized accounts by adding an access control modifier. For example, using OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl
