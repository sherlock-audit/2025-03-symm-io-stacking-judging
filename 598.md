# # Reward Rate Manipulation in SymmStaking Contract


*Any user can manipulate reward rates by notifying small reward amounts, extending the reward period and diluting rewards for stakers*

## Summary

*Missing access control on the `notifyRewardAmount` function will cause a significant loss of rewards for stakers as malicious actors can extend reward periods with minimal contributions, diluting the reward rate and manipulating the distribution timeline.*

## Root Cause

*In `contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:282-299` the `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks proper access control:*

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

    uint256 len = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        if (amount == 0) continue;
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```

The function is callable by any external address and doesn't restrict who can add rewards. This allows malicious actors to extend reward periods with minimal contributions, manipulating the reward rate calculation in `_addRewardsForToken`.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one reward token must be whitelisted by an admin via `configureRewardToken`
2. An initial legitimate reward distribution must have been set up, creating a reward period
3. The contract must not be paused

## External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker must have a small amount of the whitelisted reward token
2. Gas prices must be low enough to make the attack economically viable

## Attack Path

1. Admin sets up a legitimate reward distribution of 100 WBTC over 7 days
2. The contract calculates the reward rate as `rate = (100 * PRECISION_FACTOR) / (7 days)`
3. Just before the reward period ends, an attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a minimal amount (e.g., 0.0001 WBTC)
4. The contract recalculates the reward rate in `_addRewardsForToken`:
   ```solidity
   uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
   uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
   state.rate = ((amount * PRECISION_FACTOR) + leftover) / state.duration;
   ```
5. This extends the reward period by another 7 days (`DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION`)
6. The new rate is significantly lower than the original rate, diluting rewards for all stakers
7. The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely, continuously extending the reward period with minimal contributions

## Impact

*The stakers suffer a significant dilution of rewards, potentially losing 90-99% of their expected returns if the attack is sustained.*

For example:
- Original reward: 100 WBTC over 7 days
- Attacker adds: 0.0001 WBTC just before period ends
- New reward rate: ~14.3 WBTC per day → ~0.014 WBTC per day
- Stakers who expected to receive their full rewards within 7 days now have their rewards stretched over ~700 days

This manipulation effectively locks stakers' rewards for an extended period and significantly reduces the APY of the staking protocol, potentially causing users to withdraw their funds and damaging the protocol's reputation.

## PoC
Here's a simple calculation example demonstrating the attack:

```solidity
// Initial legitimate reward setup
Initial reward amount = 100 WBTC
Reward duration = 7 days = 604,800 seconds
PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e27

// Calculate initial reward rate
Initial rate = (100 WBTC * 1e27) / 604,800 seconds
Initial rate = 1.65343915e23 (scaled by PRECISION_FACTOR)

// Fast forward to day 6.9 (99% of the reward period)
Remaining time = 604,800 * 0.01 = 6,048 seconds
Leftover rewards = 6,048 seconds * 1.65343915e23 = 1.0e27 WBTC (scaled)

// Attacker adds minimal amount
Attacker reward amount = 0.0001 WBTC

// New rate calculation
New rate = ((0.0001 WBTC * 1e27) + 1.0e27) / 604,800 seconds
New rate = 1.65344082e20 (scaled by PRECISION_FACTOR)

// Reward rate reduction
Rate reduction = (1.65343915e23 - 1.65344082e20) / 1.65343915e23 * 100%
Rate reduction ≈ 99.9% reduction

// Impact on stakers
Original daily rewards = 14.28 WBTC per day
New daily rewards = 0.0143 WBTC per day
```

This calculation shows that by adding just 0.0001 WBTC (worth ~$2.80 at $28,000/WBTC), an attacker can dilute the reward rate by 99.9%, effectively extending what should be a 7-day distribution to approximately 700 days.


## Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, implement one of the following solutions:

1. **Add Access Control to `notifyRewardAmount`**:
   ```solidity
   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
       external 
       nonReentrant 
       whenNotPaused 
       onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
       // existing code
   }
   ```
 OR

2. **Implement Minimum Reward Amount**:
   ```solidity
   function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       // existing code
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
           // ...
           if (amount < MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT) revert InsufficientRewardAmount(amount, MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT);
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```
