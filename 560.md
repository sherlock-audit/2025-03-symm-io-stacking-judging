# No access control on notifyRewardAmount() allows malicious user to set the rewardRate to 0

### Summary

This allows malicious user to supply 1 wei of reward tokens to the contract after the period finishes.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration; //@audit 1/604800 = 0
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
If user decides to collect the rewards they will be 0 as rate == 0.
This could be done for every reward token every time.

### Root Cause

No access control on notifyRewardAmount()


### Internal Pre-conditions

Reward period should end

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. 1 week period is just about to end.
2. Malicious user backruns it with notifyRewardAmount() with 1 wei of reward tokens

### Impact

No rewards will be distributed making the stake contract useless

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to notifyRewardAmount()
