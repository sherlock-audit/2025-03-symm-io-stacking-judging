# Read-only reentrancy in getLiquidityQuote leads to incorrect calculations when adding liquidity

Description:
The `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()` function is vulnerable to read-only reentrancy attacks. This function makes external calls to Balancer's pool contract without any reentrancy protection:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247
```solidity
function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
    uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
    uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
    uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

    usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
    usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
    lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
}
```
The vulnerability exists because the function relies on external view calls to retrieve pool state (`getCurrentLiveBalances()` and `totalSupply()`), and these values are used directly for critical calculations. If an attacker can manipulate these values during a transaction, they can cause the function to return incorrect token ratios.

The results from this function are then used in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity()` to determine how many tokens to swap and how many LP tokens to expect:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L171
```solidity
function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    (uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);
    // ...
}
```
The existing protective measures - `minLpAmount` and `maxUsdcIn` parameters - are inadequate because they're compared against potentially manipulated values from getLiquidityQuote.

## Impact:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Manipulate the calculated token ratios, causing users to receive fewer LP tokens than they should
- Bypass slippage protection by manipulating the expected LP token amount that determines the default slippage threshold
- Force users to provide more USDC than necessary for a given amount of SYMM

Since these manipulations affect actual token transfers, users could lose significant value when interacting with the contract's liquidity functions

## Recommended Mitigation:
Change `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote()`  from a view function to a non-view function that implements reentrancy protection
