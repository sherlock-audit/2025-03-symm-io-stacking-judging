# Reward tokens are very likely to not be removable because pendingRewards will be greater than 10 due to inaccuracies when calculating the rate

### Summary

In `pendingRewards`, it shows exactly how many rewards for a token are in the contract. Since these tokens are distributed over a certain period of time, a rate is calculated at which they are released. During the calculation, small inaccuracies likely occur, which causes the rate to be rounded down. This leads to the fact that not all pending rewards can be distributed, as a remainder is left due to the inaccuracy. Since it is quite possible that this remainder is greater than 10, a token can no longer be removed because of it.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L288
In `notifyRewardAmount`, you can see that all tokens sent to the contract as rewards are added as `pendingRewards`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L369-L375
`_addRewardsForToken` calculates the rate by dividing the reward amount by the duration, which corresponds to one week, or 604800 seconds.
There may be small inaccuracies in this. For example, let's assume the reward amount is 10e18: `rate = 10e18 / 604800 = 16534391534391`. 
If you now multiply this rounded amount by a week, you get `9999999999999676800`. This is the amount that can be distributed at most, as the rate cannot be more precise than this. It means that the` pendingRewards` for this token will decrease to a maximum of 323200 if all possible rewards at this rate are claimed. This means the token can no longer be removed because `pendingRewards` can no longer go below 10:

### Internal Pre-conditions

The reward amount must not be exactly divisible by 604800, as otherwise no inaccuracy would occur. However, this is very unlikely anyway, and since notifyRewardAmount can be called by anyone, anyone can also send an odd amount as rewards there.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A new rewards token is being configured
2. A reward amount of 10e18 is notified
3. It takes some time, and all possible rewards are claimed
4. There is a problem with the new reward token, and it should be removed. However, this is no longer possible because the `pendingRewards` for the token cannot be less than 10.

### Impact

If there are issues with a reward token (e.g., it has a security vulnerability) and it needs to be removed, this cannot be done because this function is blocked.

### PoC

The following test can be added to `token/tests/symmStaking.behavior.ts` and started with `npx hardhat test --grep "removing reward token fails"`:
```solidity
	it("removing reward token fails", async () => {
		//Admin configures new reward token
		await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdcToken.getAddress(), true)
		
		//User1 stakes 100 SYMM
		await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), e("100"))
		await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(e("100"), user1.address)

		//There is a reward of 10 USDC
		await usdcToken.approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), e("10"))
		await symmStaking.notifyRewardAmount([await usdcToken.getAddress()], [e("10")])

		time.increaseTo(await time.latest() + 2*604800) //Two weeks pass

		await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards() //User1 claims his rewards. Since he is the only user, all the rewards that are available are claimed.
		//Shows that pendingRewards is not 0 because the rate was rounded down
		console.log("symmStaking pendingRewards: ", await symmStaking.pendingRewards(await usdcToken.getAddress()))
		
		//Reverts because pendingRewards is greater than 10
		await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdcToken.getAddress(), false)
	})
```
