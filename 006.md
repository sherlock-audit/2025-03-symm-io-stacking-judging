# _claimRewardsFor() Does Not Check Token Balance (Full TX Reverts)

### Summary

The _claimRewardsFor() function in SymmStaking contract attempts to transfer all pending rewards for a user. However, if the contract lacks sufficient balance for even one reward token, the entire transaction reverts, preventing users from claiming any rewards.

This issue can cause denial of service (DoS) for reward claims, forcing users to wait until the missing token is replenished.

### Root Cause

- _claimRewardsFor() loops through all reward tokens and calls safeTransfer() for each.
- If a token does not have enough balance, the transfer fails, reverting the entire transaction.
- This blocks users from claiming any of their rewards, even for tokens that do have sufficient funds.

Vulnerable Code in _claimRewardsFor() : https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385-L400

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract tracks user rewards and has a list of whitelisted reward tokens.
- Reward balances are updated via _updateRewardsStates().


### External Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract holds multiple reward tokens, but one or more tokens may have insufficient funds due to:

  -   Incorrect funding by reward managers.
  -   Unexpected reward claims exceeding the available balance.
  -   Admin mistakenly withdrawing reward tokens using rescueTokens().

2. A user attempts to claim rewards via claimRewards().

### Attack Path

- A reward token runs out of balance (e.g., USDT rewards are depleted).
- A user calls claimRewards() to withdraw all available rewards.
- The contract loops through all reward tokens in _claimRewardsFor().
- When the contract reaches the underfunded token, safeTransfer() fails and reverts the entire transaction.
- User receives NO rewards, even if other tokens are available.
- Denial of Service (DoS) â†’ No one can claim rewards until the missing token is replenished.

### Impact

- Users cannot claim any rewards if one token is missing.
- Users must wait for the admin to manually fix balances.
- Users may lose faith in the staking system if claims repeatedly fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement Partial Reward Claiming (Skip Underfunded Tokens)
Instead of reverting, skip tokens with insufficient funds and allow users to claim available rewards.
Fixed Code for _claimRewardsFor()

```solidity
function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];

        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[user][token] = 0;
            pendingRewards[token] -= reward;

            uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

            // Check if the contract has enough balance before transferring
            if (contractBalance >= reward) {
                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
                emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
            } else {
                // Log an event for underfunded token instead of reverting
                rewards[user][token] = reward; // Restore user's balance
                pendingRewards[token] += reward; // Restore pending rewards
                emit RewardClaimed(user, token, 0); // Log failure
            }
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
