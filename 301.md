# Untracked Locked Claims Lead to Over-Distribution in Vesting Resets

### Summary
The Vesting contract manages token vesting plans, where tokens are released to users over time. Tokens are locked in a plan with a total amount (e.g., 1000 tokens) that vest over a period (e.g., 10 months). For simplicity, assume linear vesting: 100 tokens unlock each month. Users can claim tokens that have vested based on elapsed time (e.g., after 2 months, 200 tokens are unlocked). Users can claim unvested (locked) tokens early, but with a penalty (e.g., 50% penalty, so claiming 100 locked tokens yields 50 tokens to the user, with 50 going elsewhere, like a penalty receiver).

The `_resetVestingPlans()` function is used to reset the vesting amount for a user’s plan. Before resetting, it:
- Claims any unlocked but unclaimed tokens for the user.
- Sets a new vesting amount (amount) and resets the `claimedAmount` to 0, starting a new vesting schedule over the remaining duration.

The current validation in [_resetVestingPlans()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231) checks that the new amount is at least as large as the `unlockedAmount()` the total tokens that have vested based on the original schedule up to the current time. However, this check overlooks tokens claimed early from the locked portion, which creates the issue.


### Root Cause

The problem lies in the check `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount())`. This ensures the new vesting amount isn’t less than the unlocked amount, but it doesn’t account for the total tokens a user has already received, including early claims of locked tokens. Since locked claims aren’t tracked separately in `claimedAmount` (which only tracks unlocked claims), the total tokens a user has taken can exceed `unlockedAmount()`.

```solidity
	function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
@>			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```


### Attack Path
- User gets a vesting plan with 1000 tokens over 100 days (10 tokens/day).
- Time moves to day 50; user claims 500 unlocked tokens.
- User claims 300 locked tokens early with a 50% penalty, receiving 150 (total claimed: 650).
- After claiming 300 locked tokens, vesting plan is reset to (500 - 300) = 200 tokens.
- Time advances to day 75; 100 tokens unlocked from remaining 200 locked.
- Admin resets vesting to 1500 tokens; reset claims 100 unlocked from old plan (total claimed: 750), check passes (1500 > 100), ignoring 750 already claimed.
- Time moves to day 99; user claims 1440 from the new plan (60 tokens/day × 24 days).
- Before reset: 650 tokens (500 unlocked + 150 from locked).
- At reset: +100 tokens (unlocked from old plan) = 750 tokens.
- New start time: day 75 (block.timestamp at reset).
- New end time: day 100 (75 + 25 days remaining).
- Vesting rate: 1500 tokens / 25 days = 60 tokens per day.
- Time elapsed since reset (day 75 to day 99): 24 days.
- Unlocked amount now: 60 tokens/day * 24 days = 1440 tokens.
- Result: Total claimed: +1440 tokens = 750 + 1440 = 2190 tokens exceeding even the new 1500 amount.

### Impact

Users could claim more tokens than they’re entitled to after a reset.

### Mitigation

The contract should validate the new amount against the total tokens received (unlocked + locked after penalty), not just `unlockedAmount()`.
