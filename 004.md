# Claiming large rewards through FlashLoan due to no time limit

### Summary

In SymmStaking, users can stake Symm tokens and receive rewards. However, because users can immediately claim rewards and withdraw after staking without any time limit, they can manipulate and receive rewards through FlashLoan.

### Root Cause

```solidity
	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(receiver);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
		totalSupply += amount;
		balanceOf[receiver] += amount;
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
	}

	/**
	 * @notice Withdraws staked SYMM tokens.
	 * @param amount The amount of tokens to withdraw.
	 * @param to The address receiving the tokens.
	 */
	function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
		totalSupply -= amount;
		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}

	function claimRewards() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);
		_claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);
	}

	function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return
			((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
			rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
	}

```
The `withdraw()` and `claimRewards()` functions can be called immediately to claim rewards and withdraw to release staking, regardless of how long the user has been staking. In this case, it allows everything to happen within a single transaction

The user's rewards are updated with the return value of the `earned()` function inside the `_updateRewardsStates()` function. In the `earned()` function, the larger the `balanceOf[account]` value, the greater the rewards that can be obtained

To summarize all of the above, users can borrow stakeable tokens through FlashLoan, stake the borrowed tokens in SymmStaking, acquire large rewards, then immediately withdraw through the `withdraw()` function to repay the FlashLoan debt, and obtain large rewards


### Attack Path

1. Borrow
2. Call the deposit() function to start staking and update the balanceOf value
3. Call the claimRewards() function to update rewards -> Receive rewards
4. Call the withdraw() function to get back the staked balance and repay the FlashLoan

### Impact

Users can receive rewards beyond what could be obtained through normal logic by using FlashLoan

### Mitigation

- Introduction of minimum staking period

   - Block reward claims for a certain period (e.g., 24 hours or 48 hours) after staking
   - Record staking timestamp and verify minimum elapsed time when claiming

- Prevention of same transaction

   - Prevent staking and claiming or claiming and withdrawal from occurring within the same transaction
   - Verify through recording transaction hash or block number
