# Attacker can decrease the overall reward amount by notifying dust.

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function allows anyone to notify rewards, even with tiny amounts. 
Adding a dust amount of reward can reduce the overall reward amount.

### Root Cause

- [`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L372-L374) computes the new reward rate as:  
  ```solidity
  state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
  ```
Overall reward amount is `state.rate * state.duration`.
- If `amount` is dust, then `new state.rate * state.duration < old state.rate * remaining`, leading to decrease of overall reward amount.

### Attack Path

1. Normal `notifyRewardAmount` happens:
amount = 1000e6, duration = 604800(1 week)
old rate = amount / duration = 1,653
2. Then, malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount` function with dust amount( = 1):
Duration of block in base is 2 seconds: remaining = 604800 - 2 = 604,798.
leftover = 604,798 * 1,653 = 999,731,094
new rate = (1 + 999,731,094) / 604800 = 1,652
overall reward amount = new rate * duration = 1,652 * 604800 = 999,129,600
3. `leftover > overall reward amount decreases:
leftover = 999,731,094
overall reward amount = 999,129,600
decrease amount = leftover - overall reward amount = 601,494 = 0.6$

If attacker repeats malicious adding reward, overall reward amount will decrease significantly and this means that this issue has HIGH severity.

### Impact

Reward for stakers decreases after malicious `notifyReward`.

### Mitigation

- Ensure the new overall reward amount is not lower than the old reward amount:  
  ```solidity
  uint256 newRate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
  if (newRate * state.duration < leftover) revert("...");
  ```
