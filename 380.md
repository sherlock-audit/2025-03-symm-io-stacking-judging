# Incorrect handling of pendingRewards in rescueTokens() prevents token removal

## Summary
When the admin withdraws reward tokens using rescueTokens(), pendingRewards is not updated. This leads to an inconsistency where pendingRewards holds a non-zero value, even though the contract does not actually have the tokens. Consequently, the admin is unable to remove the token from the reward system due to the OngoingRewardPeriodForToken check in configureRewardToken().

## Root Cause
pendingRewards[token] is not reduced when tokens are withdrawn via rescueTokens().

## Attack Path
- Admin calls rescueTokens(token, amount, receiver), removing tokens but not updating pendingRewards[token].
- Later, the admin tries to remove the token using configureRewardToken(token, false).
- The function reverts due to pendingRewards[token] > 10, preventing removal.
- The token remains stuck in the reward system, even though the contract has no actual balance.

## Impact
Admin cannot remove reward tokens that have been withdrawn.
Stale token rewards remain in the system without any actual balance, misleading users.
Contract is in an inconsistent state, preventing proper reward management.

## Mitigation
Update pendingRewards[token] inside rescueTokens() to reflect the amount withdrawn:
```solidity
pendingRewards[token] -= amount;
```
