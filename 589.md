# Using `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` in the `Vesting` contract without checking whether the transaction is successful could potentially cause users to lose their funds

## Summary
In the `Vesting` contract, there are three instances where the `transfer` function is used without any checks. As a result, if the transaction fails, there will be no revert, and users could lose their funds.

## Mitigation

If you want to use the `transfer` function, it should be written like this:

```diff
-   IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
+   bool success = IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
+   if(!success){
+       revert Failed_Transfer();
+   }
``` 

However, this solution can lead to additional problems because some non-standard ERC20 tokens, such as USDT on the Ethereum mainnet, do not return any value. Therefore, for convenience, it is recommended to use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`, eliminating the need for any checks, as shown in the following approach:

```diff
-   IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
+   IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);
```
