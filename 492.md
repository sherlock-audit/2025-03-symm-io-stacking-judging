# Beneficiary will bypass vesting cliff for themselves

### Summary

A logical flaw in the vesting contract allows a beneficiary to call `claimLockedToken`  (or `claimLockedTokenByPercentage`) with a zero value. This call resets the vesting schedule—setting the start time to the current block timestamp—effectively bypassing any initial cliff without incurring any penalty. As a result, a beneficiary can begin vesting earlier than intended, gaining an unfair timing advantage.


### Root Cause

- **Missing Input Validation:**  
  The functions do not enforce `require(amount > 0)` or `require(percentage > 0)`, so calls with zero values are processed. In [contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol:160](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L160)
- **Unintended Vesting Reset:**  
  A zero-value call still triggers internal logic (via `_claimUnlockedToken` and `resetAmount`), rebasing the vesting schedule to `block.timestamp` while keeping the total locked amount unchanged.
- **Log Pollution:**  
  The contract emits events (e.g., `LockedTokenClaimed`) with zero amounts, cluttering the logs.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A vesting plan exists with a non-zero locked amount.
2. The vesting period has not yet fully started or is in the cliff period.
3. The contract is active (not paused) and ready to process claims.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The caller is the vesting beneficiary.
2. The transaction is sent before the vesting start time (if a cliff exists).
3. No external dependencies affect the function call.

### Attack Path

1. **Identify Vesting Plan:**  
   The beneficiary (or an attacker controlling a vesting plan) observes that tokens are locked with a defined cliff.
2. **Execute Zero-Value Claim:**  
   The attacker calls `claimLockedToken(token, 0)` (or `claimLockedTokenByPercentage(token, 0)`), triggering the internal reset.
3. **Reset Vesting Schedule:**  
   The vesting plan is rebased: `startTime` becomes the current timestamp while `endTime` remains unchanged.
4. **Repeat as Desired:**  
   The attacker can repeat the process to continuously reset the vesting schedule, ensuring tokens start unlocking immediately.


### Impact

- **Bypass of Vesting Cliff:**  
  The beneficiary starts receiving tokens earlier than planned, undermining the vesting conditions.
- **Unintended State Changes:**  
  Repeated zero-value calls alter the vesting schedule without real token movement, potentially causing log clutter and inefficient state updates.
- **Economic Advantage:**  
  Beneficiaries gain an unfair timing advantage, which might disrupt the tokenomics if cliffs are essential for proper vesting.


### PoC

1. **Setup:**  
   A beneficiary is allocated 1000 tokens with a 3-month cliff (vesting starts on July 1, 2025).
2. **Exploit:**  
   On August 1, 2025 (during the cliff), the beneficiary calls `claimLockedToken(SYMM, 0)`.  
   - The function processes the call, triggering `_claimUnlockedToken` (which does nothing if no tokens are unlocked) and then calls `resetAmount` with the same locked amount.  
   - The vesting plan’s `startTime` is updated to August 1, 2025, effectively bypassing the cliff.
3. **Result:**  
   The beneficiary now begins receiving tokens immediately, instead of waiting until the original cliff end.


### Mitigation

- **Input Validation:**  
  Add `require(amount > 0)` in `claimLockedToken` and `require(percentage > 0)` in `claimLockedTokenByPercentage` to reject zero-value calls.
- **Optional No-Op Handling:**  
  Alternatively, if a zero-value call should only claim unlocked tokens without resetting the schedule, handle it with an early return without state modifications.
- **Reduce Log Noise:**  
  Prevent emission of events when no meaningful state change occurs.
