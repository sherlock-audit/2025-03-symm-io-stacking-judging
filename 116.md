# Penalty Bypass Vulnerability in Locked Token Withdrawal Mechanism

### Summary

The `Vesting.sol::_claimLockedToken` function in the smart contract allows users to withdraw locked tokens while enforcing a penalty fee. However, an attacker can exploit this mechanism by withdrawing tokens in small increments multiple times, effectively bypassing most or even all of the penalty fee. This occurs because the penalty is calculated per withdrawal, allowing the attacker to minimize or eliminate deductions by making repeated micro-withdrawals. This vulnerability can lead to significant financial losses for the protocol by allowing users to withdraw their locked funds with minimal or no penalties.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises due to the way the penalty fee is calculated in the _claimLockedToken function:

```solidity
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
```

Key Issues:
Per-Withdrawal Penalty Calculation:

The penalty is computed based on the amount withdrawn in each transaction.
If an attacker withdraws a small amount multiple times instead of withdrawing everything at once, they can significantly reduce the total penalty paid.
Lack of Minimum Withdrawal Limit:

The contract does not enforce a minimum withdrawal amount, allowing an attacker to withdraw in extremely small increments (e.g., 1 token).
If lockedClaimPenalty is a small percentage (e.g., 10%) and the withdrawn amount rounds down to zero, no penalty is applied.
Cumulative Withdrawal Loophole:

Since the penalty is applied per transaction rather than on the total locked amount, breaking the withdrawal into multiple steps enables an attacker to bypass most of the intended deductions.
Exploit Mechanism:
Instead of withdrawing 100 tokens in one transaction (which incurs a full penalty), an attacker could write a malicious contract that withdraws 1 token at a time in a loop, reducing or eliminating penalties due to rounding.
If the penalty calculation rounds down to zero on small withdrawals, no penalty will be deducted, allowing the attacker to extract nearly all locked funds without incurring meaningful penalties.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker withdraws tiny amounts (e.g., 1 token per transaction).
Since penalty = (1 * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18 rounds down to 0, no penalty is deducted.
The attacker loops this process until all tokens are drained with minimal or no penalties.

2. Why This Happens?
Solidity does not support floating-point numbers, so any fractional results from division truncate to the nearest whole number.
If lockedClaimPenalty < 1e18 (e.g., 5% penalty → 5e16), then:
(1 * 5e16) / 1e18 = 0
Since 1 * 5e16 = 5e16, and dividing by 1e18 truncates to zero, the penalty is zero.

3. Exploit in Action
Assume an attacker has 100 locked tokens.
If they withdraw 1 token at a time, they trigger the penalty calculation 100 times.
Each time, the penalty rounds down to zero, allowing the attacker to withdraw without paying meaningful penalties.
By the end, they fully withdraw 100 tokens while avoiding most penalties.

```

Bypassing Penalty Fees

The attacker can withdraw locked tokens in small increments, significantly reducing or completely avoiding the intended penalty fee.
This undermines the contract’s economic model, allowing users to claim locked tokens with minimal or no penalty.
Financial Loss for the Protocol

The penalty mechanism is designed to disincentivize early withdrawals and reward the protocol or stakers.
By bypassing this fee, the protocol loses expected revenue from penalties, potentially affecting liquidity, staking rewards, or overall ecosystem stability.
Unfair Advantage to Attackers

Legitimate users who withdraw normally will incur full penalties, whereas attackers exploiting the issue can avoid them.
This creates an unfair system where malicious actors can withdraw funds more efficiently than honest users.
Potential Drain of Vested Token Pool

If multiple users exploit this vulnerability, the locked token pool could be drained at a much lower cost than intended.
This could impact governance mechanisms or other aspects relying on the vesting system.
Reputation and Trust Risks

If discovered and exploited publicly, the protocol may face reputational damage.
Users may lose confidence in the fairness and security of the vesting system, leading to decreased participation.
