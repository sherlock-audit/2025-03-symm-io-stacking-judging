# `block.timestamp` is used as deadline in `PERMIT2.approve`


## Summary

Deadline check for PERMIT2.approve is not effective, allowing pending transaction to be unexpectedly executef.

## Vulnerability Details

At present, when adding liquidity to acquire SYMMLP balancer tokens, the PERMIT2.approve function uses `block.timestamp` as its deadline.

This practice is discouraged because in case of a congestion in base L2, the approval for the add liquidity operation being executed in a manner that is detrimental to the user. The block in which it is eventually included will correspond to `block.timestamp`, providing no real protection.

Additionally, the slippage parameters provided by the user may become outdated.

## Root Cause
Usage of `block.timestamp` for deadline offers no protection.

## Impact 
Outdated slippage might be used, which can cause userto unknowingly perform a bad addition of liqudity

## Mitigation

Consider allowing user to pass in a user inputted deadline instead of using the current block.timestamp for the approvals to be expired properly
