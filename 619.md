# Unrestricted `notifyRewardAmount` function allows reward manipulation

### Summary

The [notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292) function lacks access control, allowing anyone to trigger reward recalculation with minimal amounts, which can dilute rewards for legitimate stakers.

### Root Cause

The [SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292) function is used by external contracts to provide rewards for stakers. 

However, it lacks access control mechanisms, allowing any address to notify new rewards as long as the token is whitelisted. When called before an existing reward period ends, the function processes remaining rewards by adding them to the current reward amount and redistributing them over the next duration period.

```solidity
@> function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        
        if (amount == 0) continue;
        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>      state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users should have staked.
2. There should be at least 1 legitimate distribution of rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user has staked using `deposit()`
2. A legitimate contract calls `notifyRewardAmount()` and provides reward tokens for distribution over the configured duration
3. After some time malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei, which will calculate the remaining rewards until the end of the duration, add them to the 1 wei and recalculate the rate for the new duration.

### Impact

Forcing remaining rewards to be distributed over a new duration period, effectively reducing the rewards per second for legitimate stakers. This will result in reduced APR for the users

### PoC

1. Contract has 1000 reward tokens scheduled for distribution over 1 week
2. After 3.5 days, 500 tokens are still pending distribution
3. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei contribution
4. The remaining 500 tokens + 1 wei are now distributed over a new 1 week period
5. This reduces the reward rate from ~142 tokens/day to ~71 tokens/day

### Mitigation

### Option 1: Add Role-Based Access Control
Create a role for whitelisted contracts, who are trusted to call `notifyRewardAmount()`

### Option 2: Separate Reward Periods
Maintain separate reward periods for each notification instead of combining them with existing rewards. This would prevent manipulation of existing reward schedules.
