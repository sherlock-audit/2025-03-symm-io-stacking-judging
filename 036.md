# [M-07] Raw Transfer Calls in Vesting Contract

## Summary

The Vesting contract uses raw ERC20 `transfer()` calls instead of SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()`, which could lead to silent failures with certain non-compliant ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Vesting.sol, there are multiple instances where raw `transfer()` calls are used instead of SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()`:

Code reference: Vesting.sol#L272-L274 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272-L274

1. In the `_claimUnlockedToken` function (line 272):
```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
```

Code reference: Vesting.sol#L295-L296 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L295-L296

2. In the `_claimLockedToken` function (lines 295-296):
```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

The issue is that some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure but instead return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The standard ERC20 interface specifies that `transfer()` should return a boolean, but the contract does not check this return value. If a token transfer fails silently (returns `false` instead of reverting), the contract will continue execution as if the transfer succeeded.

This is particularly concerning because:

1. The contract already imports and uses SafeERC20 (lines 6 and 13), but doesn't use it for these critical transfer operations.
2. The contract updates state variables before making these transfers, so if a transfer fails silently, the state would be inconsistent with the actual token balances.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

1. **Silent Transfer Failures**: If a token's `transfer()` function returns `false` instead of reverting on failure, the contract will not detect the failure and will continue execution.

2. **State Inconsistency**: The contract updates state variables (like `totalVested` and `claimedAmount`) before making transfers. If a transfer fails silently, these state variables would be incorrect, leading to accounting discrepancies.

3. **Fund Loss**: Users might be unable to claim their tokens even though the contract's state indicates they have claimed them, effectively resulting in a loss of funds.

4. **Protocol Insolvency**: Over time, these accounting errors could accumulate, potentially leading to a situation where the protocol believes it has distributed more tokens than it actually has.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Vesting.sol:272 (_claimUnlockedToken function)
IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);  // Raw transfer call

// Vesting.sol:295-296 (_claimLockedToken function)
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);  // Raw transfer call
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);  // Raw transfer call
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace all raw `transfer()` calls with SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()` to ensure that failed transfers will revert:

```solidity
// In _claimUnlockedToken function
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

// In _claimLockedToken function
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```

This change ensures that any transfer failure will cause the transaction to revert, preventing state inconsistencies and potential fund loss. The contract already imports and uses SafeERC20, so this change is straightforward and consistent with the rest of the codebase.
