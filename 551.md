# Attacker can exploit precision loss in low decimal reward tokens in SymmStaking

### Summary

If 6 decimal tokens like USDC are used as reward tokens in SymmStaking, attacker can repeatedly call notifyRewardAmount() with 1 wei of the token and reduce the rate at which it is distributed, possibly to 0. 

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the rate at which reward tokens are distributed does not have an additional multiplier for precision. Or possibly a lack of minimum deposit limit.
```solidity
          function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

The reward token used is assumed to be USDC.
Since default for duration is 1 week or 604800, attacker can abuse precision loss by supplying 1 wei of USDC to notifyRewardAmount() every block so the calculation for reward rate constantly cuts off some amount of USDC (302400 wei or 0.3 USDC on average). Considering that gas on Base is cheap and block time is around 2 seconds, attacker can potentially reduce the rate so much so that thousands of USDC are not distributed to stakers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

USDC or other low decimal high value token is used as a reward token in SymmStaking

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls notifyRewardAmount() with 1 wei of the token once per block
2. [SymmStaking:374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) rate calculation leaves some token due to precision loss (`duration-1` wei at most) every time
3. After thousands of calls rate gets so low no stakers receive the reward token

### Impact

Stakers get diminished rewards in the token, potentially none.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement an additional multiplier when calculating rate to account for precision loss
