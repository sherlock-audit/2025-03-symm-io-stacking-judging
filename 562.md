# `Vesting::claimLockedTokenByPercentage()` will claim too many rewards in case it frontruns a previous claim locked call

### Summary

`claimLockedTokenByPercentage()` [claims](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L167) a percentage calculated off chain of the current locked tokens. In case it gets frontrunned by a `Vesting::resetVestingPlans()` increasing/decreasing the amount of locked tokens or a `Vesting::claimLockedToken()` or similar call, the percentage will not match the expected amount of tokens from the user. This means the user may end up paying a bigger penalty fee or in case of `addLiquidityByPercentage()`, allocating less liquidity to `SYMM_LP` and losing fees.

### Root Cause

The percentage functions do not check if the total amount is the same as the calculated off chain and no transaction changed it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `SymmVesting::addLiquidityByPercentage()` is called by the user.
2. `Vesting::claimLockedTokenFor()` is called by the operator frontrunning the user.
3. User adds much less liquidity.

Or, any other combination, such as the user early unlocking and paying a bigger fee due to a reset call that increased their vested amount and they withdrew too many tokens.

### Impact

User allocates liquidity, withdraws or pays fees too much/little.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

When using percentages check that the state is similar to what the user was presented with in the frontend, offchain.
