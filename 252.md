# Malicious user can block the token whitelist/blacklist mechanism

### Summary

This is possible attack in the `SymmStaking` contract, due to the following block of code in the `_addRewardsForToken` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@>			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
@>			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that any address is allowed to deposit any amount of reward token. This way a malicious user can increment the `pendingRewards` mapping, without changing the `state.rate` as seen here:
```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
@>			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}

```
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@>			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
@>			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
This will lead to inflation of the rewards, without availability for those rewards to be destributed (because they don't change the `state.rate` variable)

### Internal Pre-conditions

Token being whitelisted

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.The `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` whitelists a token
2. The malicious user deposit dust amount of this whitelisted token. Can be as little as 10 because of the following check:
```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
@>			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
```
Should be a small amount, so the `state.rate` variable is not changed
3. With this the attack is over. The user incremented the `pendingRewards` mapping without changing the rate, which will make the token blacklisting impossible
