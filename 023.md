# Attacker will cause DoS through unbounded batch operations

### Summary

Unbounded array processing in setupVestingPlans and resetVestingPlans will cause complete denial of service as an admin can exceed block gas limits.

### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol:_setupVestingPlans` and `_resetVestingPlans 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L204-L237' the lack of array length validation allows processing of arbitrarily large arrays.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin role needs to be assigned.
2. Gas limit per block is approximately 30M gas.
3. Each vesting plan setup operation consumes approximately 60k gas.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Network gas limit remains consistent
2. No significant changes to EVM gas costs


### Attack Path

1. Admin (malicious or compromised) calls setupVestingPlans with extremely large arrays (>500 users)
2. Transaction exceeds block gas limit
3. All subsequent batch operations become impossible
4. Contract functionality is effectively frozen for batch operations

### Impact

  The protocol suffers complete loss of batch operation functionality:
  - Unable to setup new vesting plans in batch
  - Unable to reset existing vesting plans in batch
  - Must process each user individually, significantly increasing costs
  - In extreme cases, some users may be permanently unable to receive their vesting plans

          address[] memory users = new address[](1000);
          uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1000);
          
          for(uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
              users[i] = address(uint160(i + 1));
              amounts[i] = 1000e18;
          }
          
          // This will revert due to exceeding block gas limit
          vm.expectRevert();
          vesting.setupVestingPlans(
              address(0),
              block.timestamp,
              block.timestamp + 365 days,
              users,
              amounts
          );
      }
  }
  ```

### Mitigation

  1. Implement array length limits:
     ```solidity
     uint256 private constant MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100;
     
     function _setupVestingPlans(
         address token,
         uint256 startTime,
         uint256 endTime,
         address[] memory users,
         uint256[] memory amounts
     ) internal {
         if (users.length > MAX_BATCH_SIZE) revert BatchTooLarge();
         // ... rest of the function
     }
     ```
  2. Add pagination support for large operations
  3. Implement chunking mechanism for batch processing
  4. Add emergency operation mode for handling edge cases
