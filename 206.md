# `setUpVestingPlans()` updates `totalVested` wrongly

### Summary

The  [`setupVestingPlans()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L204-L215) function is supposed to create vesting plans for multiple users. Each user gets a certain amount of tokens vested. The code adds the amount for each user to `totalVested[token]`. But the issue arises when the same user is set up multiple times.

### Root Cause

```solidity
//Line 210
totalVested[token] += amount;
```

The `setupVestingPlans()` function unconditionally adds new vesting amounts to `totalVested` without checking if the user already has an existing vesting plan. When a vesting plan is re-set for the same user, the old vesting amount is not subtracted from `totalVested`, leading to double-counting.

### Attack Path

- Imagine if a user already has a vesting plan with `100` tokens.  
- If the `setVestingPlans()` function is called again for the same user with a new amount of `200` tokens, the current code would add `200` to totalVested, making it `300`. 
- But the user's old vesting plan of `100` was already accounted for in totalVested. So the `totalVested` should actually be `200`, not `300`. The problem is that the code doesn't subtract the old amount before adding the new one.



### Impact

**High** - This leads to an overstatement of the `totalVested` because each time the setup is called for the same user, their new amount is added without considering previous amounts. The `totalVested` is supposed to represent the sum of all tokens that are currently vested across all users. If a user's vesting plan is updated, the old amount should be subtracted from `totalVested` before adding the new amount. The contract’s actual token balance might not cover `totalVested` if it’s artificially inflated. This could prevent users from claiming tokens later

### Mitigation

Check if the user already has an existing vesting plan. If they do, subtract the old `amount` from `totalVested` before adding the new amount. This way, `totalVested` accurately reflects the sum of all current vesting plans.
