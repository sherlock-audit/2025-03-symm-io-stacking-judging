# Unsafe Token Transfer in Vesting Contract

### Summary


Missing SafeERC20 usage in transfer functions will cause silent failures for non-standard ERC20 tokens for users as the contract will not revert on failed transfers despite importing and using SafeERC20.

### Root Cause

In `Vesting.sol`, despite importing and declaring SafeERC20 usage:
```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```
The contract uses unsafe direct transfers in two critical functions:
1. `_claimUnlockedToken()`: Line 254
```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
```
2. `_claimLockedToken()`: Lines 282-283
```solidity
IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have vesting plans set up with non-standard ERC20 tokens
2. Users need to have claimable amounts greater than 0
3. Contract needs to hold sufficient token balance


### External Pre-conditions

1. Token needs to be a non-standard ERC20 implementation that fails silently on transfer
2. Token needs to be whitelisted and used in vesting plans


### Attack Path

1. Admin sets up vesting plan with non-standard ERC20 token
2. User attempts to claim tokens via `claimUnlockedToken()`
3. Transfer fails silently but state updates occur
4. User loses their claimable tokens as the contract marks them as claimed despite failed transfer


### Impact

The users suffer a complete loss of their vested tokens when claiming. The contract's state is updated as if the transfer succeeded, but users never receive their tokens.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace unsafe transfer calls with safeTransfer:

```solidity
function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);  // Use safeTransfer
    // ... existing code ...
}

function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount - penalty);  // Use safeTransfer
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);  // Use safeTransfer
    // ... existing code ...
}
```
