# Division by Zero in `getLiquidityQuote` When Pool is Empty

### Summary

The `getLiquidityQuote` function calculates the required USDC amount and expected LP amount before adding liquidity. However, if the pool has no liquidity (i.e., `symmBalance == 0`), a division-by-zero error will occur when computing `usdcAmount` and `lpAmount`. This issue prevents liquidity addition when the pool is empty.

### Root Cause

- The function performs division using `symmBalance` in:

- If `symmBalance == 0`, the above expressions will cause a division-by-zero error.
- The function does not handle the scenario where the pool is empty.

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

- **Liquidity Addition Failure:** The addLiquidityByPercentage function fails when the pool is empty, preventing initial liquidity provision.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Their should be another logic to handle calculation results when pool is empty
