# `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote` will revert if the pool is not pre-funded

### Summary
If the pool is not pre-funded and the  `symmBalance` of the pool is zero the function will revert due to overflow/division by zero.

Inside `getLiquidityQuote` the `symmBalance` of the pool is sole denominator and used to calculate the USDC amount and the LP amount for a liquidity action. If the balance of the symm token is zero inside the pool the function will revert.

```solidity
	function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;//@audit division by zero
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance; //@audit division by zero
	}
```



### Root Cause

The contract cannot correctly handle the situation where the current Symmio token balance of the pool is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User's must have a vesting plan setup so that they are eligible to vest their LP tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The pool must not be pre-funded.

### Attack Path

1. Call either the `addLiquidity` or the `addLiquidityByPercentage` and the call will revert due to the logic in the `getLiquidityQuote` function.

### Impact

The `SymmVesting` contract will not function correctly since the main function `addLiquidity` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L99
will revert since the  `getLiquidity` function is called in the process. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L172

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following line of logic to the `getLiquidityFunction`

```diff
    uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

+        if (symmBalance == 0 && totalSupply == 0) {
+            return (usdcAmount, symmAmount);
+        }

        usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
```
