# Incorrect Reward Rate calculation in case rewards are notified again

### Summary

After configuring a reward token, the rewards can be notified again. This can happen while the duration of the period.
In case there is still duration left, the new reward rate is calculated based on the amount of tokens remaining and the newly added tokens.

Issue in the Current Implementation:  

- The remaining time in the period is **302,400 seconds**.  
- The reward rate is **2**.  
- The leftover balance is **604,800**.  
- A new amount of **302,400** is added.  
- The updated reward period is now **1 week**, making the total duration **1.5 weeks**.  
- The new rate is calculated as:  604800 + 302400 / 604800 = 1
- The contract holds **907,200 tokens** but will only distribute **604,800 tokens**.  

This issue persists for any multiple of **one week in seconds**.  

### Root Cause

Following reward rate calculation will tuncate in case the token amount is not dividable by one week in seconds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward token is configured
2. Rewards are notified

### External Pre-conditions

The second rewards notification either: deposits amount less then one week in seconds
OR The second rewards notification happens at a time, which results in leftover rewards being less then one week in seconds.  

### Attack Path

Can happen in normal operation by mistake or it can be triggered by an attacker like described in a different report. 
Note here is that the possibility of this happening is fairly high.

### Impact

Rewards are lost / incorrectly distributed.
