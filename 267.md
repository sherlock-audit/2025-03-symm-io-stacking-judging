# Malicious users can bypass the time-based vesting restrictions and extract most of their tokens early.

### Summary

The vesting contract's percentage-based claim mechanism can be exploited to extract significantly more tokens than should be available during the vesting period. A malicious user can claim more than their total vested token allocation by exploiting the interaction between percentage-based locked token claims and unlocked token claims, due to `claimedAmount `being reset to 0 after each locked claim.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the interaction between `claimLockedTokenByPercentage`  and `claimUnlockedToken` functions, combined with how `resetAmount` handles `claimedAmount`.
The docs state users should only be able to get 50% of their total allocation [Early Unlock Mechanism](https://docs.symmio.foundation/token-related/tokenomics/vesting-and-early-unlock) when choosing early unlock, forfeiting the other 50%.
However, the implementation proves users can extract almost his total funds through multiple small percentage claims, effectively bypassing the intended 50% penalty on the total amount.( **we can proof it later in POC**).

As we can see in : 
[ claimLockedTokenByPercentage](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L167)

```solidity
// In LibVestingPlan.sol
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    self.claimedAmount = 0;  // Key vulnerability - resets claim tracking
    self.amount = amount;
    return self;
}
// In Vesting.sol
function claimLockedTokenByPercentage(address token, uint256 percentage) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    _claimLockedToken(token, msg.sender, (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, token) * percentage) / 1e18);
}
```
My example should be with 200 token vested , so  the exact values with the 50% penalty through 6 iterations is : 

Starting point:

Total tokens: 200
At 25% vesting: 50 unlocked, 150 locked
Iteration 1:

Unlocked: 50 tokens
45% of 150 locked = 67.5
After 50% penalty: 33.75
Total: 83.75
Iteration 2:

Remaining locked: 82.5
45% of 82.5 = 37.125
After 50% penalty: 18.56
Plus new unlocked amount
Continuing through iterations 3-6, the amounts get smaller each time due to:

Decreasing locked token pool
Consistent 50% penalty on each claim
New unlocked amounts based on updated schedule
This explains why later in the test shows diminishing increases: 117.5 -> 154.6 -> 175.0 -> 186.2 -> 192.4 -> 195.8

The penalty effectively slows down token extraction, but users can still access more tokens than intended at 25% vesting through repeated interactions. 
```solidity
Initial unlocked: 50 tokens
Iteration 1: 117.5 tokens (+67.5)
Iteration 2: 154.6 tokens (+37.1)
Iteration 3: 175.0 tokens (+20.4)
Iteration 4: 186.2 tokens (+11.2)
Iteration 5: 192.4 tokens (+6.2)
Iteration 6: 195.8 tokens (+3.4)
```

### Impact

The real impact is bypassing the time-based vesting restrictions .Thus  Users can front-run their vesting schedule and extract most of their tokens early, ( **even with the 50% penalty in place**.) undermining the core purpose of the vesting contract.

as we can see : 

At 25% vesting (50 tokens unlocked)
Through multiple percentage claims, user extracts 195+ tokens
This is +3.5x more than should be available at this point
