# Any user will delay reward distribution for stakers and the protocol

### Summary

Lack of access control and a minimum notification amount in the `notifyRewardAmount` function will cause indefinite delay of reward distribution for stakers as any user can repeatedly reset the reward period by depositing trivial amounts. This attack path enables a malicious actor to spam the function with minimal deposits, overriding the admin’s intended reward schedule.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol:notifyRewardAmount` , the function lacks both proper access control and enforcement of a minimum notification amount. This means that any user—not just an authorized admin or reward manager—can call the function with arbitrarily small amounts (e.g., 1 wei). When invoked, the function calls `_addRewardsForToken`, which updates the token’s reward state by resetting `state.periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + state.duration` and recalculating `state.rate` based solely on the amount notified. As a result, a malicious actor can repeatedly trigger the function with trivial deposits, effectively overriding and resetting the reward distribution schedule set by the admin. This repeated resetting interferes with the intended distribution timeline, as the reward period is continuously extended based on these minimal inputs, allowing the attacker to indefinitely delay the proper distribution of rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any user needs to call `notifyRewardAmount` to set `rewardState[token].periodFinish` to be updated to `block.timestamp + duration` with a trivial amount (e.g., 1 wei).
2. An admin should have already notified a significant reward amount (e.g., 100,000 tokens over 7 days) so that the intended reward schedule is active and susceptible to resets.
3. The reward token must be whitelisted so that the function does not revert on the check for `isRewardToken[token]`.

### External Pre-conditions

 No specific external protocol conditions are required; the vulnerability exists solely due to the internal logic of the contract.

### Attack Path

1. Admin Action:  
   The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a large reward (e.g., 100,000 tokens) intended to be distributed evenly over a 7-day period.
2. Malicious Actor Action:  
   A malicious user repeatedly calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a trivial amount (e.g., 1 wei) for the same reward token.
3. State Update:  
   Each call triggers `_addRewardsForToken`, which resets `state.periodFinish` to `block.timestamp + state.duration` and recalculates `state.rate` based on the new minimal deposit.
4. Resulting Effect:  
   The reward period is continuously extended, effectively delaying the distribution of the admin’s significant reward amount almost indefinitely.

### Impact

Stakers suffer from a delayed reward distribution because the reward period never concludes as intended by the admin. This manipulation undermines trust in the protocol, and stakers will experience uncertainty or reduced rewards over time. The admin’s planned reward schedule is compromised, and the malicious actor effectively delays the proper release of rewards without immediate financial gain but with a potentially disruptive impact on the protocol.

### PoC

Preconditions

1. Deployment and Setup:
   - The original version of the `SymmStaking` contract is deployed.
   - A reward token (e.g., `REWARD_TOKEN`) is whitelisted (i.e., `isRewardToken[REWARD_TOKEN] == true`).
   - The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a significant reward amount (e.g., 100,000 tokens) intended to be distributed evenly over a fixed duration (e.g., 7 days).  
     *This sets the token’s reward state with:*  
     - `state.duration = 7 days`
     - `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + 7 days`
     - `state.rate` calculated based on the 100,000 tokens.

2. Attacker Setup:
   - A malicious actor holds an account that can interact with the contract.
   - There is no role restriction on `notifyRewardAmount` so the attacker is allowed to call it.
   - The attacker is prepared to call `notifyRewardAmount` with a trivial amount (e.g., 1 wei).

Attack Path

1. Admin Notifies a Large Reward:
   - Action: Admin calls:
     ```solidity
     notifyRewardAmount([REWARD_TOKEN], [100000 * 1e18]);
     ```
   - Effect:  
     - The contract sets the reward period for `REWARD_TOKEN` to end at `t0 + 7 days`.
     - The reward rate (`state.rate`) is set based on 100,000 tokens over 7 days.

2. Attacker Spams Trivial Notifications:
   - Action: Immediately after the admin’s call (or periodically throughout the reward period), the attacker calls:
     ```solidity
     notifyRewardAmount([REWARD_TOKEN], [1]); // 1 wei (trivial amount)
     ```
   - Internal Execution:  
     - The function does not enforce any access control, so the attacker is allowed to call it.
     - Since `block.timestamp < state.periodFinish` (from the admin’s original notification), the `_addRewardsForToken` function executes the **else branch**:
       ```solidity
       uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
       uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
       ```
     - Here, `amount` is 1 wei. This recalculates the reward rate using the leftover rewards from the remaining time.
     - Then, the function resets:
       - `state.lastUpdated` to the current timestamp.
       - **Critically, `state.periodFinish` is reset to `block.timestamp + state.duration`** (i.e., another full 7 days from the moment of the attacker’s call).
   
3. Repeat the Process:
   - The attacker repeatedly calls `notifyRewardAmount` with the trivial amount before the current reward period expires.
   - Each call resets `state.periodFinish` further into the future.
   - Result: The original 7-day period never concludes; stakers never reach the point where the reward distribution for the 100,000 tokens is completed.

4. Observations:
   - The reward period is effectively extended indefinitely as long as the attacker continues to spam these minimal notifications.
   - The admin’s intended reward schedule is subverted, causing delays in reward accrual and distribution to stakers.

Simulated Code Snippet (Pseudocode)


```javascript
// Assume `staking` is an instance of the deployed SymmStaking contract
// and `attacker` is a signer representing the malicious actor.

// Step 1: Admin notifies a large reward
await staking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount(
  [REWARD_TOKEN],
  [ethers.utils.parseEther("100000")]  // 100,000 tokens (assuming 18 decimals)
);

// Capture the initial period finish
let initialPeriodFinish = await staking.rewardState(REWARD_TOKEN).then(state => state.periodFinish);
console.log("Initial period finish:", initialPeriodFinish.toString());

// Step 2: Attacker repeatedly notifies trivial rewards
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Attacker calls with 1 wei reward amount
  await staking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount(
    [REWARD_TOKEN],
    [1]  // 1 wei
  );
  // Fetch and print the updated period finish after each call
  let updatedPeriodFinish = await staking.rewardState(REWARD_TOKEN).then(state => state.periodFinish);
  console.log(`Updated period finish after call ${i + 1}:`, updatedPeriodFinish.toString());
  
  // Wait a short time (simulate attacker spamming)
  await delay(5000); // delay 5 seconds (pseudocode, implement as needed)
}
```

Expected Outcome:
- Each time the attacker calls the function, the printed `periodFinish` value resets to a new timestamp equal to the current block timestamp plus the fixed duration (e.g., 7 days).
- This confirms that the attacker’s calls are delaying the intended reward distribution.

### Mitigation

- Implement Access Control:  
  Restrict the `notifyRewardAmount` function to only trusted roles (e.g., using `onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)` or similar) to ensure only authorized parties can notify new reward amounts.
- Enforce a Minimum Notification Amount:  
  Add a check that requires the notified amount to be above a certain threshold, preventing trivial deposits that can reset the reward period.
- Reward Period Safeguard:  
  Consider adding logic that prevents resetting the reward period if a significant reward distribution is already active, or enforce a cooldown period between notifications.


1. Implement Access Control

Restrict the `notifyRewardAmount` function to only allow calls from a trusted role (e.g., reward manager):

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) // Access control added
{
    // ...
}
```

---

2. Enforce a Minimum Notification Amount

Define a constant for the minimum amount and add a check inside the function:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT = 1e18; // Example: minimum of 1 token (with 18 decimals)

if (amount < MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT) {
    revert NotificationAmountTooLow(amount, MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT);
}
```

---

3. Reward Period Safeguard (Cooldown Enforcement)

Define a cooldown constant and a mapping to track the last notification time for each token, then enforce a cooldown check:

```solidity
uint256 public constant NOTIFY_COOLDOWN = 1 hours;
mapping(address => uint256) public lastNotificationTime;

if (block.timestamp < lastNotificationTime[token] + NOTIFY_COOLDOWN) {
    revert NotificationCooldownActive(token, lastNotificationTime[token] + NOTIFY_COOLDOWN);
}

// After processing, update the last notification time:
lastNotificationTime[token] = block.timestamp;
```

---

Combined Modified Snippet

Below is the updated snippet for the `notifyRewardAmount` function incorporating all three mitigations:

```solidity
// Required constants and mappings:
uint256 public constant MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT = 1e18; // Minimum amount (e.g., 1 token with 18 decimals)
uint256 public constant NOTIFY_COOLDOWN = 1 hours;
mapping(address => uint256) public lastNotificationTime;

// Modified notifyRewardAmount function:
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) // Access control applied
{
    _updateRewardsStates(address(0));
    if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

    uint256 len = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address token = tokens[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        // Enforce minimum notification amount
        if (amount < MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT) {
            revert NotificationAmountTooLow(amount, MIN_NOTIFY_AMOUNT);
        }

        // Enforce a cooldown period to prevent frequent notifications
        if (block.timestamp < lastNotificationTime[token] + NOTIFY_COOLDOWN) {
            revert NotificationCooldownActive(token, lastNotificationTime[token] + NOTIFY_COOLDOWN);
        }

        if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        _addRewardsForToken(token, amount);

        // Update last notification time for this token
        lastNotificationTime[token] = block.timestamp;
    }
    emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
}
```

This resolution ensures that:
- Only trusted roles can call `notifyRewardAmount`,
- Notifications below a specified threshold are rejected, and
- Frequent notifications for the same token are prevented by a cooldown period.
