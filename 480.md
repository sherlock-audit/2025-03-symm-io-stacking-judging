# Incorrect reward token removal condition allows active tokens to be removed

### Summary

`configureRewardToken` function wrongly checks if there are active rewards with the token that will be removed, causing stuck of rewards.



### Root Cause

In `configureRewardToken` before a reward token is removed, it is checked if there are ongoing rewards with this token. 
```js
if (!status) {
	if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
However, the check is wrong, and the function should revert if `pendingRewards[token] > 0` not 10. Removing a token under these conditions could result in unclaimable rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A reward token is removed from the whitelist.

### External Pre-conditions

The token that will be removed should have `pendingRewards` > 0 but < 10.

### Attack Path

1. The `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` while pendingRewards[token] is between 1 and 10 units.
2. The function incorrectly allows the token to be removed from the whitelist instead of reverting.
3. Users expecting to receive pending rewards from this token will no longer be able to claim them.

### Impact

Users will be unable to claim pending rewards.
