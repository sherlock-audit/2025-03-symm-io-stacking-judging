# Wrong check in VestingPlan::_resetVestingPlans limits amount that can be set when resetting vesting

### Summary

the check in _resetVestingPlans ensures that the amount being set is greater than the unlocked amount 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

however this doesnt make any sense, if anything the new amount should be checked against the lockedAmount as it is effectively replacing the locked amount 

SN: Unfortunately nothing was written in the docs about this, however After discussing with the team, it was found out that the check was necessary for how reset worked before and the new amount should actually be completely independent of the old amount 

### Root Cause

bad check in _resetVestingPlans

### Internal Pre-conditions

user unlocked amount is greater than the amount they are meant to claim for the rest of the vesting process

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

1. bob has unlocked 500,000 symm and has 200,000 locked 
2. protocol wants to increases bob locked amount from 200,000 to 210,000 (eg due to rewards from other users early unlocking)
3. since 210,000  is less then 500,000 the call will revert preventing the protocol from updating 

second scenerio 
1. bob has 100,000 symmLP unlocked from and another 20,000 locked as well as some locked symm tokens 
2. bob wants to use his locked symmio tokens as liquidity and the new lp is 20,000 symmlp 
3. since the new total 20,000 + 20,000 is not up to the unlocked symmlp, the call will revert 

### Impact

Protocol wont be able to properly reset user amounts as they may want to reset it to amounts under unlockedAmount

potential dos when adding liquidity 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The check should be removed
