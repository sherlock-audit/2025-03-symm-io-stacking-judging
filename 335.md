# Fixed slippage parameter may cause Denial of Service during times of high volatility

### Summary

In SymmVesting::_addLiquidity, there is hardcoded slippage of 99%. This could result in an inability for transactions to be processed during times of high volatility. 

### Root Cause

Here there is a hardcoded value for slippage, this causes a lack of flexibility as well as potentially preventing transactions from going through during times of high volatility. If there is an extended period of high volatility it is possible that there is a complete inability for transactions to go through, preventing liquidity from being added for a potential extended period of time.
