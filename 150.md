# Incorrect checking logic in the function _resetVestingPlans will cause the addLiquidity function to fail.

### Summary

The function _resetVestingPlans is used to reset the amount of locked tokens, which is usually called when adding liquidity. However, there is one weird check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L226-L235

```solidity
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
>@			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
```

The amount to be reset will be compared with the amount already unlocked. This is hard to understand. The correct check here should be to compare with the current locked amount. The current check means that adding liquidity may fail when a user has unlocked more than half of their tokens.

### Root Cause

Wrong check in the function _resetVestingPlans 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has a vestingPlan with token LP
2. User has unlocked more than half of  LP tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. User add liquidity to increase the LP token

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The call to addLiquidity will be DOSed due the wrong check of the function _resetVestingPlans.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

if (amount < vestingPlan.lockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
