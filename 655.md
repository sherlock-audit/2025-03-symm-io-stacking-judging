# `SymmStaking.sol` is upgradeable, but it does not reserve `gap` space for future new state variables.

### Summary

`SymmStaking.sol` is an upgradeable contract, but it does not reserve `gap` space for future new state variables. If new state variables are added in a new version of the contract, the storage layout may be altered, potentially causing data corruption or logical errors.

### Root Cause

As shown in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/README.md#overview-of-contract) of staking, the `SymmStaking.sol` contract is upgradeable. However,  `SymmStaking.sol` does not reserve `gap` space for future new variables, unlike what is implemented in [`Vesting.sol:66`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L66). 

In Solidity, the storage layout is fixed. If new state variables are added in a new version of the contract, it could alter the storage layout, potentially causing incompatibility with the old version. Such incompatibility may lead to data corruption or logical errors.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin updates `SymmStaking.sol` to a new version, and the new version adds some new variables.


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If new state variables are added in a new version of `SymmStaking.sol`, the storage layout may be altered, potentially causing data corruption or logical errors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reserve a `gap` to ensure storage compatibility during upgrades.
```solidity
142: 	// Mapping from reward token to the total pending rewards (i.e. rewards that have been notified but not yet claimed).
143: 	mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRewards;

+	uint256[50] private __gap;
