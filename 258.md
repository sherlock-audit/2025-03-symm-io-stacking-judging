# Missing `upgradeToAndCall` Function in `SymmVesting` Prevents Proxy Upgrades

### Summary

The `SymmVesting` contract cannot be upgraded through the `ProxyAdmin` because it lacks an `upgradeToAndCall` function that the proxy calls via delegatecall during the upgrade process. This architectural flaw makes the contract permanently immutable despite being designed as upgradeable.

### Root Cause

The `SymmVesting` contract (which inherits from the `Vesting` base contract) lacks an `upgradeToAndCall` function that is required when upgrading through a proxy. During upgrade attempts, the proxy delegates this call to the current implementation, which fails if the function doesn't exist.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `SymmVesting` is deployed behind a proxy for upgradeability
2. The proxy forwards upgrade calls to the implementation via delegatecall
3. Neither `SymmVesting` nor its parent `Vesting` contract implements the necessary upgrade handler

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol admin attempts to upgrade the `SymmVesting` contract to a new version.


### Attack Path

1. ProxyAdmin calls `upgradeAndCall` to upgrade the `SymmVesting` implementation contract
2. The proxy delegates this call to the current `SymmVesting` implementation contract
3. The implementation doesn't have an `upgradeToAndCall` function to handle this
4. The upgrade transaction reverts, preventing any implementation changes

### Impact

The `SymmVesting` contract cannot be upgraded, despite being designed as an upgradeable contract. This means:

1. No bug fixes can be applied
2. No new features can be added
3. No changes to vesting parameters or calculations
4. The contract becomes effectively immutable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an `upgradeToAndCall` function to the `Vesting` contract:
```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external {
    // Empty implementation to handle proxy upgrade calls
}
```
