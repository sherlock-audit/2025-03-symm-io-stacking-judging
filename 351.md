# An incorrect check on `_resetVestingPlans`.

### Summary

If the admin want resert any users vesting plan, then he won't be able to create a new vesting plan according to how much user token was locked in previous schedule.

```solidity
function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
>>>			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```

### Root Cause

The problem is here that, if admin resets the vesting plan when there is some locked token on that plan, so according to that remaining locked token, he would not able to set these locked tokens to the new vesting plan.
(i.e -> user locked token was 40, now admin cannot reset this vesting plan to create a new vesting plan with this 40 amount. However if the admin provides some more tokens then he might create as well, but its not the correct flow because until and unless user is not providing more token to the new plan , we should not set some token for him.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

If the user has claimed more than lockedAmount, then admin needs to provide more token than actually user has locked to reset his vesting plan.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

Admin needs to provide more tokens than how much remaining `lockedAmount` the user vesting plan has in the contract, in order to reset his vesting plan. Incorrectly checking the amount to reset.

### PoC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

- Let's say user initially have a vested plan with 100 token for 10 days.
- After 6 day user claims 60 tokens now `lockedAmount` will be = 40. 
- Now if the admin wants to reset this vesting plan, he needs to provide amount more than equal to 60 (which is unlocked).
- So the problem is here that, since the `lockedAmount` is only 40 but admin will have to reset his plan with 60 amount or more than that.

i.e -> if `lockedAmount` is 40 , now the admin want to reset this vesting plan for new vesting plan from the present, then admin needs to provide more tokens than `lockedAmount`.

Let's also assume that admin provide 60 amount to reset the vesting plan , however we know that user has only provided 100 tokens initially but due to this behavior, he would be claiming total = 60 (claims with previous plan) + 60 (can claim with new plan). 100 != 60 + 60 ====> Wrong.
```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
		self.startTime = block.timestamp;
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
		self.amount = amount;
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}
```

### Mitigation

Instead check with lockedAmount:
```diff
- if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
+ if (amount < vestingPlan.lockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```
