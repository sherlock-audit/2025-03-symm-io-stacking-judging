# Incorrect Token Order Assumption in Liquidity Quote Calculation

### Summary

The `SymmVesting` contract makes a critical assumption about the ordering of tokens in the liquidity pool by hardcoding the indices for SYMM and USDC. Specifically, it assumes that the pool's first token (`balances[0]`) is always SYMM and the second (`balances[1]`) is always USDC. If the pool’s token order deviates from this expectation (for example, if USDC appears first), the liquidity quote calculations will be entirely inaccurate. This miscalculation can lead to wrong amounts of tokens being used or minted, potentially opening the door to exploits that may harm users or the pool’s integrity.


### Root Cause


The issue stems from the following code snippet in the `getLiquidityQuote` function and related liquidity addition logic:

```solidity
// Retrieve pool tokens. Assumes poolTokens[0] is SYMM and poolTokens[1] is USDC.
IERC20[] memory poolTokens = POOL.getTokens();
(IERC20 symm, IERC20 usdc) = (poolTokens[0], poolTokens[1]);

...

uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];
```

This directly accesses the balances using fixed indices (0 for SYMM and 1 for USDC) without verifying that the tokens at those indices match the expected addresses.In many decentralized liquidity pools, the order of tokens can vary based on the pool’s configuration. This fixed assumption can lead to significant miscalculations when the token order is different.

### Attack Path

Not have any attack path

### Impact

- Users may deposit tokens based on incorrect liquidity quotes, resulting in unintended token transfers or value loss.
- Inaccurate calculations can lead to over- or under-minted LP tokens, disturbing the pool’s balance and potentially destabilizing the liquidity provider’s share.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


- **Dynamic Token Index Resolution:**  
  Instead of hardcoding the indices, the contract should iterate over the token list returned by `POOL.getTokens()` to dynamically determine the indices for SYMM and USDC. For example:

  ```solidity
  // Dynamically find the token indices for SYMM and USDC
  uint256 symmIndex;
  uint256 usdcIndex;
  IERC20[] memory tokens = POOL.getTokens();
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      if (address(tokens[i]) == SYMM) {
          symmIndex = i;
      }
      if (address(tokens[i]) == USDC) {
          usdcIndex = i;
      }
  }
  uint256 symmBalance = balances[symmIndex];
  uint256 usdcBalance = balances[usdcIndex];
  ```
