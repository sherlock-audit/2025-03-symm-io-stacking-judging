# Unrefunded SYMM Tokens in liquidity addition functionality

### Summary

The `_addLiquidity` function (called by _addLiquidityProcess which called by addLiquidity) transfers SYMM and USDC tokens from the user, interacts with Balancer V3 liquidity router, and refunds unused USDC. However, **it fails to refund unused SYMM tokens**, which can result in permanent loss of user-owned SYMM if the actual amount consumed by the pool (`amountsIn[0]`) is less than the provided `symmIn`.

**The slippage check on `lpAmount` does not protect against this issue, as it only ensures a minimum LP token output and does not account for residual SYMM tokens.**

### Details

Now, in transfering the tokens to balancer pool, `ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional` is called with the following params:

```solidity
    // Call the router to add liquidity.
        amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
            address(POOL),
            amountsIn,
            expectedLpAmount,
            false, // wethIsEth: bool
            "" // userData: bytes
        );
```

But, if we check the actual router contract here ⇒ https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/40b4cd30889103dd17c0d87bc7d3d397823b65a0/pkg/vault/contracts/Router.sol#L118

We’ll see that the `amountsIn` param corresponds to `maxAmountsIn` param **as balancer pool can always have some tokens unused.**

```solidity
 function addLiquidityProportional(
        address pool,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        uint256 exactBptAmountOut,
        bool wethIsEth,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external payable saveSender(msg.sender) returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn) {
        (amountsIn, , ) = abi.decode(
            _vault.unlock(
                abi.encodeCall(
                    Router.addLiquidityHook,
                    AddLiquidityHookParams({
                        sender: msg.sender,
                        pool: pool,
                        maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
                        minBptAmountOut: exactBptAmountOut,
                        kind: AddLiquidityKind.PROPORTIONAL,
                        wethIsEth: wethIsEth,
                        userData: userData
                    })
                )
            ),
            (uint256[], uint256, bytes)
        );
    }
```

We see the code takes into account that some tokens might be lost and has the following check for USDC:

```solidity
// Return unused usdc
        if (usdcIn - amountsIn[1] > 0) usdc.safeTransfer(msg.sender, usdcIn - amountsIn[1]);
```

But it doesn’t have a check for the unused/lost SYMM tokens. What will happen to them? 

If we go back to `_addLiquidityProcess` function we’ll see these lines:

```solidity
 // Add liquidity to the pool.
        (amountsIn, lpAmount) = _addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);

        // Update SYMM vesting plan by reducing the locked amount.
        symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);
```

So, user’s vesting will be reset without taking the lost SYMM tokens into account.

In the end, the user effectively will lose some amount of SYMM tokens.

---

### **Impact**

- **Permanent loss of SYMM**: Excess SYMM tokens not used during liquidity provisioning remain trapped and lost.
- **Violates user expectations**: Users expect all unused tokens (both SYMM and USDC) to be refunded.

---

### **Proof of Concept**

- User calls `addLiquidity` with certain amount of SYMM tokens
- Specified amount of tokens are sent to the router
- Not all tokens are deposited to the pool because they are taken as maximum amount, not actual amount, and since they’re not refunded, they get lost in limbo

### Recommendation

Account for unused SYMM tokens.
