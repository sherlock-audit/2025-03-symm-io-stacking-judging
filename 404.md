# Incorrect liquidity quote in Balancer recovery mode

### Summary

The `SymmVesting#getLiquidityQuote()` retrieves Balancer pool balances using `getCurrentLiveBalances()`. However, when the pool is in Recovery Mode, these balances may be outdated or incorrect. Relying on them can lead to inaccurate liquidity quotes, causing financial loss to users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L248
Balancer V3 Recovery Mode suspends live balance updates, meaning getCurrentLiveBalances() may return stale or inaccurate balances.

The function does not check if the pool is in Recovery Mode before using these balances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User adds liquidity and Balancer V3 pool is in recovery mode.

### External Pre-conditions

Balancer V3 pool enters recovery mode and POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances() returns outdated balances.

### Attack Path

The Balancer pool enters recovery mode (e.g., due to an admin decision or protocol issue).
A user calls addLiquidity(), it calls getLiquidityQuote() to get SYMM-USDC liquidity estimates.
The function retrieves incorrect balances, leading to an incorrect USDC quote.
The user adds liquidity based on the wrong quote, resulting in unexpected LP token amounts.
The user loses funds due to incorrect liquidity provisioning.

### Impact

Users receive incorrect LP tokens due to misquoted liquidity requirements.
Funds may be lost because of incorrect USDC calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify getLiquidityQuote() to revert if the pool is in recovery mode
Or use another method to get liquidity quote(e.g. use raw tokens balances)
