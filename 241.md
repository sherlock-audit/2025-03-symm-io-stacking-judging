# `_addLiquidity` has an invalid slippage check causing loss of user funds

### Summary

In the [`SymmVesting:addLiquidity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213) function, the slippage protection process is based on pre-calculated USDC amounts (`usdcIn`) gotten from the `getLiquidityQuote()` function rather than the actual USDC amount used (`amountIn[1]`).

```solidity
(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn)
```

This means that if the pool conditions change and the actual USDC increases, the slippage check may not catch this discrepancy, potentially allowing the transaction to succeed with more USDC spent than the allowed by `maxUsdcIn`



### Root Cause

```solidity
//Line 175
if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded()
```

The root cause is that the code performs the slippage check using the outdated, pre-calculated `usdcIn` value instead of verifying the actual USDC amount (`amountsIn[1]`) returned by the router. As a result, any differences between the pre-calculated and actual amounts due to dynamic pool changes, can bypass the intended slippage protection

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Outdated liquidity quote:** The function `getLiquidityQuote()` is used to pre-calculate the USDC amount (`usdcIn`) based on the current pool balances. This value is then used in the slippage check before the actual liquidity addition.
2. The liquidity pool's state (its token balances) must change between the time the pre-calculated `usdcIn` is determined and when the router actually processes the liquidity addition. This change can lead to the actual USDC required (`amountsIn[1]`) being higher than the pre-calculated value

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users may end up spending more USDC than they intended.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

To address the slippage protection issue, the contract should enforce the `maxUsdcIn` limit using the actual USDC amount consumed (`amountsIn[1]`) rather than the pre-calculated `usdcIn`. 

```solidity
if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && amountsIn[1] > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();
```
