# Missing Safe Transfer Handling for Token Transfers

### Summary

The function _claimUnlockedToken does not use SafeERC20's safeTransfer(), which will cause transfer failures for certain tokens (e.g., USDT) for users, as IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount); does not handle tokens that do not return a boolean value. [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272#L272)

### Root Cause

In _claimUnlockedToken, the contract directly calls IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount); without using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20. Some tokens (such as USDT) do not return true/false, which can cause silent failures or transaction reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The token must be a non-standard ERC-20 (e.g., USDT, which does not return a boolean).

### External Pre-conditions

The transfer() function of the token must not return a boolean for this issue to trigger (e.g., USDT).

### Attack Path

1. A user calls _claimUnlockedToken for USDT.
2. The contract executes IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);.
3. Since USDT does not return a boolean, the function might revert or fail silently.
4. The user does not receive their vested tokens due to this incompatibility.

### Impact

Users may be unable to claim their vested tokens when interacting with USDT or other non-standard ERC-20 tokens. Funds are not lost, but they become inaccessible unless an update is made. This blocks vesting withdrawals, affecting all users relying on such tokens.
