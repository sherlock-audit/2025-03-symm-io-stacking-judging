# Stakers receive diluted rewards when admins add rewards mid-period

### Summary

In [`SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366), any new rewards added to the staking contract via `notifyRewardAmount` will reset the reward distribution period to a fresh `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` (1 week), even when called in the middle of an ongoing reward period, leading to incorrect reward rates and dilution of rewards.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken`, the reward rate and period finish calculations don't properly account for mid-period reward additions:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

When adding rewards mid-period, the function always sets `state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration`, creating a fresh reward period of `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` length instead of maintaining the original end time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward period must already be active (rewards already distributed)
2. The admin must call `notifyRewardAmount` before the current reward period finishes

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. Admin distributes initial rewards via `notifyRewardAmount`, setting a 1-week period
2. After 3 days (mid-period), admin distributes additional rewards
3. Instead of the added rewards being distributed over the remaining 4 days, they're distributed over a new 7-day period
4. This dilutes the reward rate, causing stakers to receive rewards more slowly than expected
5. The cycle can repeat, continuously extending the reward period and diluting rewards

### Impact

Stakers suffer from diluted rewards and extended vesting periods compared to what would be expected. This creates unpredictability in reward accrual and could lead to users keeping their assets staked longer than anticipated to receive full rewards.

### PoC


```javascript
it("should demonstrate reward period reset issue", async function () {
    const initialStake = e("100");
    const initialReward = e("700");
    
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), initialStake);
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(initialStake, user1.address);
    
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), initialReward);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [initialReward]);
    
    const initialRewardState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await usdtToken.getAddress());
    const initialRate = initialRewardState.rate;
    const initialPeriodFinish = initialRewardState.periodFinish;
    
    await time.increase(3 * 24 * 60 * 60);
    
    const additionalReward = e("400");
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), additionalReward);
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [additionalReward]);
    
    const updatedRewardState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await usdtToken.getAddress());
    const updatedRate = updatedRewardState.rate;
    const updatedPeriodFinish = updatedRewardState.periodFinish;
    
    expect(updatedPeriodFinish).to.be.gt(initialPeriodFinish);
    
    const expectedRateIfNotDiluted = (400 * 1e18) / (4 * 24 * 60 * 60) + initialRate;
    expect(updatedRate).to.be.lt(expectedRateIfNotDiluted);
    
    const expectedDilutedRate = ((400 + (4 * 24 * 60 * 60 * initialRate / 1e18)) * 1e18) / (7 * 24 * 60 * 60);
    expect(updatedRate).to.be.closeTo(expectedDilutedRate, e("0.001"));
}
```

### Mitigation

Modify the `_addRewardsForToken` function to maintain the original period end time when adding rewards mid-period:

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
        state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
}
```
