# `SymmStaking::ConfigureRewardToken` inadequate pending rewards check thus resulting in the removal of tokens with active rewards.

**Description:** 

The [ConfigureRewardToken](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312) function allows an administrator to remove a reward token by setting its `status` to `false`. However, the function only reverts the removal if `pendingRewards[token] > 10` over [here](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320). This means that if a token has any pending rewards less than or equal to 10 (e.g., 5 pending rewards), it can be removed, leaving those rewards orphaned and inaccessible to users.

**Impact:** 

 Removing a token while it still has pending rewards disrupts the reward distribution logic, potentially compromising the protocol’s overall functionality.  

**Proof of Concept:**

Below is table outlining the preconditions that must be met for the vulnerability in the configureRewardToken function to be exploitable:
| Precondition                           | Description                                                                                   | Example/Condition               |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Admin Role**                         | The caller must have the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to invoke the function.                        | `msg.sender` is an admin         |
| **Valid Token**                        | The token address provided must not be the zero address.                                      | `token != address(0)`            |
| **Token is Active**                    | The token must be currently whitelisted (active reward token).                                | `isRewardToken[token] == true`   |
| **Non-Zero Pending Rewards (<= Threshold)** | The token has pending rewards that are greater than zero but do not exceed the check threshold. | `pendingRewards[token] = 5` (≤ 10) |
| **Protocol Operational**               | The protocol must be in an active state (not paused) during the call.                           | `whenNotPaused` modifier passes  |
| **Reward State Update**                | The rewards update function (`_updateRewardsStates`) is executed successfully before state change. | `_updateRewardsStates` executes without error |

Now for the steps to take place for this exploit to happen.

1. Assume a token has `pendingRewards[token] = 5`.  
2. An administrator calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to remove the token from the reward system.  
3. Since 5 is not greater than 10, the check `if (pendingRewards[token] > 10)` does not revert.  
4. The token is removed, leaving the 5 pending rewards orphaned and unclaimable by users.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Update the check so that the function reverts if there are any pending rewards, ensuring that the token cannot be removed until all rewards have been claimed or processed.

On this line of [code](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320)

Replace this with;

```diff
- if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
+ if (pendingRewards[token] > 0) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
