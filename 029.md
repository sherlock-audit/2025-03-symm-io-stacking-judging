# [H-04] Last-Minute Reward Capture

## Summary
Last-Minute Reward Capture vulnerability allows users to stake just before rewards are distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail
SymmStaking.sol:389-394 allows users to claim rewards immediately after staking, without any time-based restrictions.
Code reference: [SymmStaking.sol#L389-L394](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L389-L394)

## Impact
Malicious users can front-run reward distributions, stake tokens, claim rewards, and then withdraw, effectively stealing rewards from long-term stakers.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
if (reward > 0) {
    rewards[user][token] = 0;
    pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
    emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a minimum staking period before users can claim rewards, or use a time-weighted distribution mechanism.
