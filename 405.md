# Potential Rewards Loss in SymmStaking Due to Unclaimed Rewards

### Summary

The missing automatic reward claim in withdraw function will cause loss of rewards for stakers as users who withdraw their entire stake will have no incentive mechanism to accrue additional rewards.


### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol:245-260` there is a missing automatic reward claim when users withdraw their entire staked balance:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L245-L261

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have a positive balance in the staking contract
2. User needs to have accrued unclaimed rewards
3. User needs to withdraw their entire staked balance


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls deposit() and stakes tokens
2. Protocol accrues rewards for the user over time
3. User calls withdraw() to withdraw their entire staked balance without first calling claimRewards()
4. User's balance is now zero, but they still have unclaimed rewards
5. Since the user's balance is now zero, they won't accrue additional rewards in the future
6. User may later call claimRewards() but will only receive rewards accrued up to the point of withdrawal


### Impact

The stakers suffer partial loss of rewards. Users who don't understand they need to claim rewards separately may potentially forget to claim their rewards before withdrawing, resulting in rewards being effectively lost to them.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add automatic claiming of rewards when users withdraw all their tokens, or add a boolean parameter to allow users to optionally claim rewards during withdrawal:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to, bool claimRewardsFirst) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);
    
    // Optionally claim rewards first
    if (claimRewardsFirst) {
        _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);
    }

    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
```
