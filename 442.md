# The _claimRewardsFor function in SymmStaking causes unfair reward loss for blacklisted users.

### Summary

The lack of proper handling for blacklisted users(the [USDC](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913) exists to blacklist) in the _claimRewardsFor function will cause unfair reward loss for users as the contract fails to properly distribute rewards when users are blacklisted.


### Root Cause

In the [SymmStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L393) contract, the _claimRewardsFor function does not account for users being blacklisted. This may lead to revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Rewards include USDC.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.	The user is blacklisted due to USDC or another blacklisted token.
2.	The user calls the _claimRewardsFor() function to claim rewards.
3.	The contract proceeds to loop through all the available rewards tokens, including the blacklisted ones.
4.	Due to the transfer will revert in USDC, causing a complete loss of rewards.

### Impact

Users on the USDC blacklist will lose all the rewards for tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use try to call TRANSFER, or collect each token reward separately.
