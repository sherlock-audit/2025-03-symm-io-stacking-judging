# Blacklisted user can prevent `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` from ever succeeding

### Summary

`SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` relies on the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` calling `SymmStaking::claimFor()` of all users to have `pendingRewards[token] < 10` to be able to disable a reward token. However, whenever a user is blacklisted, it will be impossible to claim rewards for this user, and the reward token will never be disabled, which is key functionality.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking:393`, the [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L393) may fail if the user is blacklisted, DoSing claiming rewards for them, stopping pending rewards from going below 10, DoSing the mechanism to disable reward tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

User is blacklisted.

### Attack Path

1. Staker is blacklisted.
2. `RewardManagerRole` calls `SymmStaking::claimFor()` which reverts because the user is blacklisted, not decreasing `pendingRewards[token]`.
3.  `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` will never succeed in disabling a reward token.

### Impact

DoSed `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` ability to disable reward tokens. It could render the contract useless or lead to stuck funds if the token became malicious and this was the reason for disabling it.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Do not push the rewards to users when claiming on behalf, but store them in a mapping so the user can call them themselves without DoSing important operations.
