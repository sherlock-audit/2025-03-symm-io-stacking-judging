# Front-running notifyRewardAmount() to Exploit Rewards distribution

### Summary

The SymmStaking contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack, where an attacker can monitor transactions and strategically deposit a large amount of SYMM tokens immediately before the **notifyRewardAmount()** function executes. This allows the attacker to claim a disproportionate share of the rewards without having staked for a significant duration, thereby undermining the fairness and security of the staking mechanism.

### Root Cause

The core issue arises from the fact that the contract does not track the duration for which tokens have been staked. Instead, rewards are calculated based on the staked balance at the time of reward distribution, allowing new deposits to instantly become eligible for rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract allows users to deposit SYMM tokens at any time.
- The notifyRewardAmount() function can be triggered to distribute new rewards.
- Rewards are calculated based on the current staked balance, without considering how long the tokens have been staked.

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker must have the ability to monitor blockchain transactions in the mempool.

- The attacker must be able to execute transactions with higher gas fees to front-run notifyRewardAmount().

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the mempool for a notifyRewardAmount() transaction.

2. The attacker front-runs the transaction by depositing a large amount of SYMM tokens.

3. The notifyRewardAmount() function executes, increasing the total reward pool.

4. Since the attacker now has a large staked balance, they receive a disproportionately high share of the rewards.

5. The attacker immediately calls claimRewards() to withdraw their allocated rewards.

6. The attacker then withdraws their staked SYMM tokens, effectively gaining free rewards with minimal risk.

### Impact

- **Unfair Reward Distribution**: Long-term stakers receive fewer rewards as the attacker dilutes their share.

- **Potential Reward Draining**: If executed repeatedly, this attack could drain the reward pool without benefiting genuine stakers.

- **Economic Incentive Distortion**: The staking mechanism loses its intended purpose of rewarding long-term participation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Implement Time-Weighted Staking**

- Track the staking timestamp for each deposit.

- Calculate rewards based on the duration tokens have been staked.

- Example: Require tokens to be staked for a minimum period before becoming eligible for rewards.
