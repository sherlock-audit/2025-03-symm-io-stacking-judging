# Admin will drain all staked/reward tokens for users as a malicious admin calls rescueTokens

## Summary:
A bug in the `rescueTokens` function allows an account with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to withdraw any ERC20 token—including the staking token and reward tokens—from the staking contract. This flaw may lead to a complete loss of user funds if the admin (or a compromised admin key) misuses the function.

## Root Cause:
In `SymmStaking.sol`, the `rescueTokens` function lacks checks to prevent transfers of core assets. The code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343C2-L344C3

```solidity
	function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
```
does not verify whether token equals the staking token or any whitelisted reward token.

## Internal Pre-conditions:
1. Caller must have the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
2. The contract holds staked funds and/or reward tokens.

## Attack Path:
1. A malicious or compromised admin calls `rescueTokens(token, amount, receiver)` with token set to the staking token (e.g., SYMM) or a reward token (e.g., USDC).
2. The function transfers the specified amount of tokens to the admin-controlled receiver.

## Impact:
Users suffer a 100% loss of staked funds and unclaimed rewards.

## PoC
This PoC simulates an admin using the `rescueTokens` function to drain the staking token from the contract.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { SymmStaking } from "../typechain-types";

describe("SymmStaking - Admin Drain via rescueTokens", function () {
  let staking: SymmStaking;
  let admin: any, user: any;
  const stakingTokenAddress = "0xStakingTokenAddress"; // Replace with actual address

  before(async function () {
    [admin, user] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const StakingFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmStaking", admin);
    staking = (await StakingFactory.deploy()) as SymmStaking;
    await staking.deployed();
    // Assume the contract holds 1000 staking tokens (e.g., SYMM) for testing.
  });

  it("should allow admin to rescue staking tokens", async function () {
    const rescueAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18);
    // Admin calls rescueTokens with the staking token address.
    await staking.connect(admin).rescueTokens(stakingTokenAddress, rescueAmount, admin.address);
    // For demonstration, one would check the token balance of admin using the token contract.
    // expect(await token.balanceOf(admin.address)).to.be.gte(rescueAmount);
  });
});
```
**PoC Explanation:**
- The Bug:
The function does not restrict which token can be rescued, so it permits the admin to withdraw core assets.

- How It Works:
In this test, the admin (with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) calls `rescueTokens` with the staking token’s address. Since there’s no check, the contract transfers all 1000 tokens to the admin.

- Attack Scenario:
An attacker controlling or compromising the admin key could execute this function to drain all user deposits and rewards, causing complete fund loss.

## Mitigation:
Add a check to restrict withdrawals of core tokens:

```solidity
require(token != stakingToken && !isRewardToken[token], "Cannot rescue staking/reward tokens")
```
