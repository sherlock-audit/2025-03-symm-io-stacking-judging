# Unrefunded SYMM in addLiquidity

### Summary

Unused SYMM tokens during liquidity addition are not refunded, leading to permanent loss of user funds.

### Root Cause

The `_addLiquidity` function fails to return unused SYMM to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls addLiquidity with SYMM tokens.
2. SYMM input exceeds the amount used in the liquidity pool.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Pool requires less SYMM than provided.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `addLiquidity` with excess SYMM.
2. Unused SYMM remains in the contract, unrecoverable by the user.
