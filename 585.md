# Vesting Plan Reduction Bypass via Liquidity Addition

### Summary

The _resetVestingPlans function in vesting.sol allows the contract owner to adjust user vesting amounts.

Liquidity Addition Exploit: Instead of withdrawing, users can call _addLiquidityProcess, transferring their locked tokens to the liquidity pool. This effectively converts their locked tokens into LP tokens, creating a new vesting schedule that is unaffected by the pending reduction.

### Root Cause

in  _resetVestingPlans function 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222-L237

No freeze period or timelock prevents users from executing transactions before an adjustment is enforced.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [User needs to have] vestingPlans[token][user].lockedAmount to be at least greater than amount (liquidity addition amount).
2. [Contract owner needs to call] _resetVestingPlans(token, users, amounts) to reduce a user’s vestingPlans[token][user].lockedAmount from {initial amount} to {reduced amount} after a delay.
3. [User needs to detect] an upcoming vesting reduction through on-chain monitoring or external notification before _resetVestingPlans is executed.
4. [User needs to call] _addLiquidityProcess(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn) to transfer lockedAmount into the liquidity pool, converting the original vesting into LP vesting.
5. [Vesting contract needs to allow] _addLiquidityProcess to execute without checking for a pending vesting reduction.
6. [Contract owner needs to execute] _resetVestingPlans(token, users, amounts) after the user has already converted their vesting into LP, making the reset ineffective.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Gas price needs to be low enough to ensure the user’s _addLiquidityProcess transaction is executed before the contract owner’s _resetVestingPlans.
2. On-chain monitoring tools or bots must be available for the user to detect when a vesting reduction is about to occur.
3. No transaction delays or congestion should occur, allowing the liquidity addition transaction to be processed quickly.
4. The liquidity pool must have sufficient capacity to accept the user’s locked tokens for LP conversion.
5. No restrictions on adding liquidity should be in place at the time the user attempts to exploit the issue.

### Attack Path

Scenerio: Liquidity Addition Exploit

1. Alice has 1,000 tokens vested.

2. The contract owner decides to reduce Alice’s vesting to 600 tokens.

3. Alice calls _addLiquidityProcess, transferring her locked tokens into a liquidity pool.

4. This moves her locked tokens into LP tokens, triggering a new vesting schedule.

5. The contract owner calls _resetVestingPlans, but it only applies to the original vesting, leaving Alice’s new LP vesting untouched.

### Impact

Users can escape vesting reductions by transferring locked tokens into a liquidity pool, thereby avoiding the intended adjustment.

Contract owner loses control over vesting allocations, making vesting management ineffective.

Potential financial loss for the protocol if token allocations cannot be adjusted as intended.

Liquidity pool abuse, where users lock tokens in LP pairs to create new vesting schedules, disrupting the vesting mechanism.

}


### Mitigation

1. Implement a Freeze Mechanism

Before reducing vesting, temporarily freeze claims and liquidity additions for affected users.

mapping(address => bool) public isFrozen;

function freezeUser(address user) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    isFrozen[user] = true;
}

Modify claimLockedToken and _addLiquidityProcess to block claims and liquidity additions if frozen:

require(!isFrozen[user], "User actions are frozen");

2. Timelock on Claims and Liquidity Additions Before Reset

Enforce a timelock (e.g., 24 hours) before vesting changes take effect.

Users cannot claim or add liquidity during this period.
