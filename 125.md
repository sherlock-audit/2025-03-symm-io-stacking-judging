# Inconsistent vesting balance in SymmVesting.sol:_addLiquidityProcess

### Summary

In **SymmVesting.sol**, the function **_addLiquidityProcess** resets the vesting plan using symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]). However, it does not update totalVested, which tracks the total vested amount in the contract. As a result, totalVested remains inaccurate, leading to potential accounting issues, incorrect vesting calculations, and possible exploitation by privileged actors.

### Root Cause

The function **_addLiquidityProcess** modifies individual user vesting plans but does not reflect these changes in the global totalVested variable. This discrepancy results in an overestimation of the total vested balance, creating mismatches between the contract's internal accounting and actual user entitlements.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- SymmVestingPlan exists and tracks a user's locked balance.

- _addLiquidityProcess modifies symmVestingPlan.resetAmount to change the user's locked balance.

- totalVested is expected to be the sum of all individual locked balances.

### External Pre-conditions

- _addLiquidityProcess is executed, reducing a user’s locked balance.

- totalVested is relied upon for other contract operations, such as withdrawals or claims.

- The contract does not have an automated mechanism to reconcile totalVested.

### Attack Path

- An actor calls _addLiquidityProcess.

- The function changes a specific user’s vesting amount but does not update totalVested.

- The total amount of vested tokens is now artificially inflated in totalVested, meaning more tokens appear locked than truly are.

### Impact

- Accounting Discrepancy: totalVested does not reflect actual locked balances, leading to incorrect reporting.

- Potential Exploitation: Privileged actors could exploit the discrepancy by manipulating vesting plans to withdraw more than allowed.

- Incorrect User Balances: Users may be prevented from withdrawing legitimate claims since calculations rely on totalVested

### PoC

1. Assume the contract holds 1,000 tokens and totalVested = 1,000.

2. A user has a locked vesting plan with 500 tokens.

3. The _addLiquidityProcess function is called with amountsIn[0] = 200.

4. symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(500 - 200) = 300, reducing the locked amount for the user.

5. totalVested remains 1,000 instead of updating to 800.

### Mitigation

Explicitly update totalVested after calling symmVestingPlan.resetAmount():
```solidity
totalVested[SYMM] = totalVested[SYMM] - symmLockedAmount + amountsIn[0];
```
