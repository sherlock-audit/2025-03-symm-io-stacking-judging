# An Attacker Can Manipulate the Reward Emission Rate

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks access control and minimum amount validation, allowing any user to add minimal reward (dust) amounts and manipulate reward emission rates and periods. This is particularly feasible on Base network where the contract is to be deployed due to low gas costs to run the attack.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275C2-L292C3
The `notifyRewardAmount` isn't access gated and no validation on cool down period or minimum amounts, allows an attacker to run an ##APR DILUTION ATTACK## by calling the function repeatedly with dust amount of the reward Token and it triggers the rate recalculation in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366C2-L380C1 which might will cause the reward release rate to become lower than actually intended, Since duration is constant, the impact accumulates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with dust amounts ( i.e. 1 USDC) repeatedly.
2. Each call resets the reward period to a new week.
3. Each call recalculates the reward rate with the minimal amount.
4. The attacker can continue this indefinitely, disrupting the reward distribution.

### Impact

1. Potential griefing of legitimate reward distributions
2. Reward rates can be diluted
3. Reward period can continuosly be extended.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Add minimum reward amount check or role restriction to the `notifyRewardAmount` function .
