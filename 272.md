The most obvious logical mismatch is in the two "claim by percentage" functions:

```solidity
function claimLockedTokenByPercentage(address token, uint256 percentage) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    _claimLockedToken(token, msg.sender, (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, token) * percentage) / 1e18);
}

function claimLockedTokenForByPercentage(
    address token,
    address user,
    uint256 percentage
) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    _claimLockedToken(token, user, (getLockedAmountsForToken(user, token) * percentage) / 1e18);
}
```

### The Mismatch

- **In the function documentation**, it says:
  > `@param percentage Percentage of locked tokens to claim (between 0 and 1 -- 1 for 100%).`

  This suggests a caller should pass something like `0.5` for 50% or `1` for 100%.

- **In the code**, the calculation is:
  ```solidity
  (getLockedAmountsForToken(...) * percentage) / 1e18
  ```
  This implies that `percentage` is actually expected to be a scaled integer (e.g., `1e18` for 100%, `5e17` for 50%, etc.). 

### Why It's a Problem

1. If a user follows the doc and passes `1` to claim 100%, they actually get:
   \[
   \text{lockedAmount} \times 1 \div 10^{18} = \text{lockedAmount} / 10^{18}
   \]
   which is essentially zero if `lockedAmount` is within standard 18 decimals range.

2. Conversely, to truly claim 100% using this code, the user must pass `1e18`, not `1`. That contradicts the comment "`1 for 100%`" in the docstring.

### Fixing It

- **Option A**: Keep the function signature/implementation as is (requiring a scaled integer) and **update the documentation** to say something like:
  > `@param percentage Percentage (scaled by 1e18). For example, 1e18 = 100%, 5e17 = 50%.`

- **Option B**: Keep the doc as is (accepting a true fraction between 0 and 1) and **update the calculation** to:
  ```solidity
  (getLockedAmountsForToken(...) * percentage) / 1
  ```
  where `percentage` would be a fixed-point fraction on-chain (though this often requires a custom fixed-point type or scaled arithmetic approach).

Either way, the mismatch must be resolved. Right now, if someone reads the doc literally and calls the function with `percentage = 1`, they would unintentionally receive only a tiny fraction of their locked tokens.
