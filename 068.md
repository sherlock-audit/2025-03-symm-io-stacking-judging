# addLiquidity operations reset vesting schedules but maintain end dates

### Summary

A design behavior in the vesting mechanism causes SymmVesting users to have their vesting schedules reset when performing addLiquidity operations. While the end date remains the same, the start time is updated to the current time, effectively compressing the vesting schedule and changing the expected token release rate.


### Root Cause

In [LibVestingPlan.sol:77-78](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L77-L78) the `resetAmount` function resets the vesting timeline to start from the current time but maintains the original end time:

```solidity
self.startTime = block.timestamp;
self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
```

This is called by `SymmVesting.sol` when users add liquidity:

```solidity
// Update SYMM vesting plan by reducing the locked amount.
symmVestingPlan.resetAmount(symmLockedAmount - amountsIn[0]);
```

Each time a user calls `addLiquidity()` or `addLiquidityByPercentage()`, their SYMM vesting plan's start time gets reset to the current timestamp, but the end time remains unchanged. This compresses the vesting schedule and changes the release rate of tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to have tokens locked in a SYMM vesting plan
2. The user needs to perform an addLiquidity operation

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has a vesting plan with tokens locked for a period (e.g., 6 months from Jan 1 to July 1)
2. On March 1 (2 months in), user calls `addLiquidity()` to convert some SYMM to LP tokens
3. The `_addLiquidityProcess()` function calls `symmVestingPlan.resetAmount()`
4. Inside `resetAmount()`, the vesting plan's start time is set to the current time (March 1) but the end time remains July 1
5. This compresses the vesting schedule from 6 months to 4 months, increasing the vesting rate
6. If the user performs another liquidity operation on May 1, the start time is reset again, further compressing the schedule


### Impact

Users experience an unexpected change in their vesting schedule when adding liquidity. While this may seem beneficial (faster vesting rate), it can cause confusion and unpredictable behavior:

1. Users who carefully planned their token vesting schedules will find their tokens being released at a different rate than expected
2. The behavior is not clearly documented, leading to confusion for users
3. The reset mechanism creates inconsistent vesting experiences depending on when users perform liquidity operations


### PoC

Add this test case on file: `token/tests/symmVesting.behavior.ts`

```typescript
	it("VULNERABILITY: Adding liquidity resets but maintains vesting end date", async () => {
		// Get current vesting plan details for SYMM token
		const SYMM = await symmToken.getAddress();
		const initialPlan = await symmVesting.vestingPlans(SYMM, await user1.getAddress());
		const initialEndTime = initialPlan.endTime;
		const initialStartTime = initialPlan.startTime;
		console.log("Initial start time:", new Date(Number(initialStartTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		console.log("Initial end time:", new Date(Number(initialEndTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		
		// Calculate remaining vesting time
		const currentTime = (await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")).timestamp;
		const remainingTime = Number(initialEndTime) - currentTime;
		const initialDuration = Number(initialEndTime) - Number(initialStartTime);
		console.log(`Current time: ${currentTime}, Remaining time: ${remainingTime}, Initial duration: ${initialDuration}`);
		
		// Fast forward 1/3 of the remaining time
		const timeSkip = Math.floor(remainingTime / 3);
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [timeSkip]);
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", []);
		
		// Check the updated block time
		const blockAfterSkip = await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest");
		console.log(`After time skip, block time: ${blockAfterSkip.timestamp}`);
		
		// Get current locked SYMM amount
		const lockedBefore = await symmVesting.getLockedAmountsForToken(await user1.getAddress(), SYMM);
		console.log(`Locked SYMM before: ${lockedBefore}`);
		
		// User adds liquidity with 50% of locked tokens
		await symmVesting.connect(user1).addLiquidityByPercentage(
			e(0.5), // 50% of locked tokens
			0,      // min LP amount
			user1UsdcAmount // max USDC amount
		);
		
		// Check updated vesting plan
		const updatedPlan = await symmVesting.vestingPlans(SYMM, await user1.getAddress());
		const updatedEndTime = updatedPlan.endTime;
		const updatedStartTime = updatedPlan.startTime;
		console.log("Updated start time:", new Date(Number(updatedStartTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		console.log("Updated end time:", new Date(Number(updatedEndTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		
		// KEY TEST: Verify the start time has been updated to current time
		expect(updatedStartTime).to.be.greaterThan(initialStartTime);
		
		// Verify the amount has been reduced
		expect(updatedPlan.amount).to.be.lessThan(initialPlan.amount);
		
		// Verify the end date remains the same (not extended)
		expect(updatedEndTime).to.be.equal(initialEndTime);
		
		// Fast forward another 1/3 of the original remaining time
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [timeSkip]);
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", []);
		
		const blockBeforeSecond = await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest");
		console.log(`Before second liquidity add, block time: ${blockBeforeSecond.timestamp}`);
		
		// User adds liquidity again with 50% of remaining locked tokens
		await symmVesting.connect(user1).addLiquidityByPercentage(
			e(0.5), // 50% of remaining locked tokens
			0,      // min LP amount
			user1UsdcAmount // max USDC amount
		);
		
		// Check vesting plan after second operation
		const finalPlan = await symmVesting.vestingPlans(SYMM, await user1.getAddress());
		const finalEndTime = finalPlan.endTime;
		const finalStartTime = finalPlan.startTime;
		
		console.log("Final start time:", new Date(Number(finalStartTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		console.log("Final end time:", new Date(Number(finalEndTime) * 1000).toISOString());
		
		// Log values for clarity
		console.log(`Initial start: ${initialStartTime}, Updated start: ${updatedStartTime}, Final start: ${finalStartTime}`);
		console.log(`Initial end: ${initialEndTime}, Updated end: ${updatedEndTime}, Final end: ${finalEndTime}`);
		
		// Verify start time changes again but end time remains the same
		expect(finalStartTime).to.be.greaterThan(updatedStartTime);
		expect(finalEndTime).to.be.equal(initialEndTime);
	});
```

### Mitigation

Modify the `resetAmount` function in `LibVestingPlan.sol` to preserve the original vesting rate while only updating the amount:


```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    
    // Simply update the amount without changing the timeline
    self.amount = amount;
    self.claimedAmount = 0;
    
    // Do not reset the start time - preserve the original vesting rate
    // self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    // self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    
    return self;
}
```

Alternatively, clearly document this behavior in user-facing documentation and UI to ensure users understand how adding liquidity affects their vesting schedules.
