# Initialization can be frontrun.

## Summary

Front-running initialization allows an attacker to set critical variables, like the owner and make symmvesting compromised for the users.

## Root Cause

Contracts utilizing an [initialization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L55) function are vulnerable to frontrunning attacks during deployment. An attacker could intercept the deployment process and assign themselves as the contract owner, as ownership is granted to the whoever calls the first. While [Symmio](https://www.symm.io/) could redeploy the compromised contracts, this would incur financial costs. Additionally, if Symmio deploys contracts without realizing they have been pre-initialized by an attacker, users could unknowingly engage with a compromised system from the outset.

```sol
/// @File:: token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol::initialize()

	// @audit-issue - frontruning by attacker
	function initialize(
		address admin,
		address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver,
		address _pool,
		address _router,
		address _permit2,
		address _vault,
		address _symm,
		address _usdc,
		address _symm_lp
	) public initializer {
		if (
			admin == address(0) ||
			_lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver == address(0) ||
			_pool == address(0) ||
			_router == address(0) ||
			_permit2 == address(0) ||
			_vault == address(0) ||
			_symm == address(0) ||
			_usdc == address(0) ||
			_symm_lp == address(0)
		) revert ZeroAddress();
		__vesting_init(admin, 500000000000000000, _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver);
		POOL = IPool(_pool);
		ROUTER = IRouter(_router);
		PERMIT2 = IPermit2(_permit2);
		VAULT = _vault;
		SYMM = _symm;
		USDC = _usdc;
		SYMM_LP = _symm_lp;
	}
```

## Impact

Medium - Users may unintentionally interact with a compromised system right away if Symmio deploys contracts without recognizing that they have been pre-initialized by an attacker.

## mitigation

To mitigate this risk, set the owner in the **constructor** and restrict the initialize() function to the owner only for the SymmVesting contract.
