# Denominator used when calculating state.rate takes an incorrect duration, resulting in lower reward rate than actual

## Summary
Incorrect denominator of reward rate will result in incorrectly lower reward rate for SYMM token stakers.

## Root Cause
In SYMMStaking.sol, admin notifies rewards via `notifyRewardAmount()`, which internally calls `_addRewardsForTokens()`. In this function, if the period has not ended, the else statement will execute -  calculation for state.rate is erroneous here.

## Vulnerability Details
In the scenario whereby period has not ended, the state.rate takes the amount + leftover, dividing it by the entire full period duration. However, this is assuming the rewards are distributed over the full duration. In actuality, these rewards should be distributed only over the remaining duration `(state.periodFinish - block.timestamp)`.

```solidity
 else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

## Impact
In the event period has not ended, rewards are being distributed over full duration instead of the remaining duration. Reward rate will be lower than actual rate. Stakers will get less rewards than expected.

## Mitigation
`state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining;`
