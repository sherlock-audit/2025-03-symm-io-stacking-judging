# Penalty fee bypass in Vesting::claimLockedToken due to rounding issue

### Summary

Users can bypass the penalty fee when claiming locked tokens via the `Vesting::claimLockedToken` function due to a rounding issue in the penalty calculation logic.

[Vesting::_claimLockedToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L261) function:
```javascript
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    ...
=>  uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
    ...
}
```

If the `amount` parameter is small enough, `amount * lockedClaimPenalty` will be less than `1e18`, causing the penalty amount to be rounded down to zero. Malicious users can exploit this by passing a very small `amount` to repeatedly claim locked tokens without paying any penalty.  

### Root Cause

The penalty calculation formula in the `Vesting::_claimLockedToken` function results in rounding down when `amount` is too small:  

```javascript
uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
```

### Impact

- Malicious users can claim locked tokens in small increments to completely bypass the penalty.  
- This could result in financial losses for the protocol, as penalty fees may not be properly enforced.

### Mitigation  

Modify the penalty calculation to **always round up**.
