# Anyone can expand reward period by calling notify rewards with a small amount

### Summary

Notify rewards can be called by anyone leading to extend of the rewards period with default time.
This will dilute previous rewards, which is not intended.

### Root Cause

The notifyRewardAmount lacks access control, allowing anyone to call this function.

Later in the call, the new finish time is extended by the duration:

This will lead to incorrect reward rate accounting, and extend the reward period unwanted.

For example:
If the current rate is **1**, there are **200 seconds** left until the period ends.  
- The remaining tokens are **200** (200 Ã— 1).  
- These tokens should be distributed over the next **200 seconds**.  
- However, due to the attack, the new reward rate for the next week is set to **0** (201 / 604800).  
- As a result, these **201 tokens are effectively lost**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward token is configured
2. Any amount of tokens are notified

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A reward token is configured
2. Any amount of tokens are notified
3. Attack notifies close to the end of the reward period with a small new amount

### Impact

The reward period is unwanted expanded, additionally the reward rate calculation is broken, leading to an incorrect rate.
This will lead to a loss of tokens in case the leftover is less then one week in seconds.
Because this attack can be repeated it allows to grief the system over time, resulting in a larger loss. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow anyone to notify rewards
