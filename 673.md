# An attacker can reset the reward rate to zero by sending a minimal amount

### Summary

A missing minimum reward amount check in _addRewardsForToken allows an attacker to reset the reward rate for an ended reward period to zero by calling notifyRewardAmount with 1 wei, which disrupts future reward calculations.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, _addRewardsForToken updates the reward rate based on the new amount. If the reward period has ended (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish), the rate is reset to amount / state.duration. An attacker can send a tiny amount (e.g., 1 wei) through notifyRewardAmount, forcing the rate to be recalculated as 1 wei / duration, effectively resetting it to zero due to rounding.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The reward period for a token has ended.
The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount() with amount = 1 wei.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The reward period for token ends (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish).
The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount([token], [1]).
_addRewardsForToken resets state.rate to 1 / state.duration, which rounds to zero.
Future reward calculations using rewardPerToken return significantly reduced or zero rewards.

### Impact

The staking contract's reward calculations become disrupted, preventing fair distribution of rewards and affecting users' staking incentives.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a minimum threshold for reward notifications to prevent tiny amounts from resetting the rate
