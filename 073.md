# An attacker can start unlocking tokens earlier if an admin has set the startTime to a point in the future and can thus avoid the 50% penalty on the prematurely unlocked tokens

### Summary

`resetAmount` sets the `startTime` of a vesting to `block.timestamp`, which is problematic if the vesting has not yet started, as it moves the start time forward and causes tokens to unlock earlier than intended. This can be exploited by an attacker through `addLiquidity` and `claimLockedToken`, as `resetAmount` is used in these functions.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L75-L81
In `resetAmount`, you can see that `startTime` is set to `block.timestamp`. This is problematic in cases where the vesting's `startTime` was in the future because it would cause the unlocking to start earlier than intended.
Someone with a vesting that has a `startTime` in the future can call two functions that allow resetting the amount on the vesting:
1. claimLockedToken:
The user can call `claimLockedToken` with an amount of 0.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L288
This ensures that `resetAmount` for the vesting is called and the `startTime` is set to `block.timestamp`. Since the amount is 0, nothing else changes in the vesting, and the user does not receive any penalty.
2. addLiquidity
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L142
Here, you can do the same as above, set the amount to 0 so that nothing else happens in the function and no liquidity is actually added, but instead, only `resetAmount` is called, and the vesting `startTime` is set to `block.timestamp`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin must create a vesting that has a startTime in the future

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin creates vesting with `startTime` > `block.timestamp`
2. The user to whom the vesting belongs then calls `claimLockedToken` with an amount of 0  
3. The vesting gets an earlier start time and starts unlocking tokens immediately instead of waiting for the start time set by the admin

### Impact

Users can claim a part of their tokens earlier than they should be able to and bypass the 50% penalty for this amount that is normally applied to early unlocking.

### PoC

The following test can be added to `token/tests/symmVesting.behavior.ts` and started with `npx hardhat test --grep "early unlock"`:
```javascript
		it("early unlocking", async () => {
			const users = [await user2.getAddress()]
			const amounts = [e("1000")]
			const startTime = await time.latest() + 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 2 weeks in the future
			const endTime = startTime + 9 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 9 months later
			
			//Admin creates a vesting that is set to start in 2 weeks
			await symmVesting.connect(admin).setupVestingPlans(await symmToken.getAddress(), startTime, endTime, users, amounts)
			
			//Shows that the startTime is moved forward by two weeks due to resetAmount in addLiquidity
			console.log("symmVesting user2 before: ", (await symmVesting.vestingPlans(await symmToken.getAddress(), await user2.getAddress())).startTime)
			await symmVesting.connect(user2).addLiquidity(e("0"), 0, e("10000"))
			console.log("symmVesting user2 after: ", (await symmVesting.vestingPlans(await symmToken.getAddress(), await user2.getAddress())).startTime)

			await time.increaseTo(await time.latest() + 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60) //Fast forward the time by 2 weeks
			
			//Shows that the user was able to claim approximately 49 tokens after two weeks without having to pay any penalty, 
			//even though the unlocking would normally only start now.
			console.log("user2 symmToken balance before: ", await symmToken.balanceOf(await user2.getAddress()))
			await symmVesting.connect(user2).claimUnlockedToken(await symmToken.getAddress())
			console.log("user2 symmToken balance after: ", await symmToken.balanceOf(await user2.getAddress()))
		})
```
