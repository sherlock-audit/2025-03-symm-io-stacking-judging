# Miscalculation of usdcAmount in `getLiquidityQuote`

### Summary

Miscalculation of the usdcAmount in `getLiquidityQuote`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247
### Root Cause

`getLiquidityQuote` is responsible for Calculating the USDC required and LP tokens expected for a given SYMM amount.
As we know the usdc token decimal equal to 6, which in the most of the case we can get result as `usdcAmount ==1`.
```solidity
	function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30); <@ audit
		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
	}
```
