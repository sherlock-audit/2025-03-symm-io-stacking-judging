# Low decimal reward tokens will be impacted by duration

### Summary

The duration for rewards emission may be too big for tokens with low decimals and high value such as wbtc. Under a certain amount of rewards the rate will be 0 due to rounding down even with non trivial numbers.

### Root Cause

The [rate](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L386)

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```
The current rate calculation in the Staking contract divides the reward amount by the staking duration in seconds. 
For tokens with low decimal precision like WBTC (8 decimals), this can result in a **zero rate**. 
For example, a reward of 6e5 satoshis ($600 for 100k BTC) distributed over 7 days would calculate to less than 1 satoshi per second, which rounds down to 0 in Solidity's integer arithmetic.
`0.6e6/(7*24*60*60)=0.99`  <= **0 in solidity**


### Internal Pre-conditions

Have WBTC as reward token 


### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

If Rewards are supplied but the resulting rate 0, the supplier would have to contact the admin to salvage the funds, these assets are not lost, but this situation is quite impactful nonetheless.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Easiest way to mitigate this would be to revert on rate 0.

```diff
//_addRewardsForToken()

state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
+ if( state.rate == 0) revert rate_is_zero();
```
