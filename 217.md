# Last-Minute Deposit Reward Manipulation Vulnerability

*Vulnerabiltiy Details*
The SymmStaking contract contains an issue that allows users to manipulate reward distribution by making a large deposit shortly before claiming rewards. This vulnerability stems from the reward calculation mechanics in the `earned()` function, which uses the user's current balance rather than a time-weighted balance when calculating accrued rewards.
[The vulnerable function is:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210C2-L214C3)
```javascript
function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    return
@>>        ((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
        rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
}
```
The issue occurs because the function multiplies the user's current balance (`balanceOf[account]`) by the accumulated reward rate difference. This calculation doesn't account for when the tokens were actually deposited, allowing users to get rewards as if their current balance had been staked for the entire period.
The contract correctly updates `userRewardPerTokenPaid` when a user deposits the `_updateRewardsStates` function, but it does not account for the change in balance when calculating the rewards that should be attributed to the user.

*Impact*
An attacker can extract a disproportionate amount of rewards by timing large deposits before claims, potentially draining the reward pool and depriving legitimate stakers of their earned rewards.

*Proof of Concept*
```javascript
Given:
- Reward rate: 1,000 tokens/day
- Initial staking pool: 100,000 tokens from other users
- Reward period: 7 days
```

## Attack:

1 Day 0: Attacker deposits 1 token

* `userRewardPerTokenPaid[attacker]` is set to current `rewardPerToken()`


2 Day 6: Attacker deposits 900,000 tokens

* `balanceOf[attacker]` = 900,001 tokens
* _updateRewardsStates()` calculates earned rewards for initial 1 token
* These rewards are stored in `rewards[attacker][token]`


3 Day 6 (same block): Attacker claims rewards

* The formula uses current balance (900,001) × accumulated rewards
* Attacker receives rewards as if 900,001 tokens were staked for 6 days


4 Day 6 (next block): Attacker withdraws 900,000 tokens

## Result:

* Legitimate earnings for 1 token staked for 6 days: ~0.06 reward tokens
* Attacker's actual claim: ~54,000 reward tokens
* Attacker locked significant capital for only minutes but claimed ~900,000× their legitimate rewards

*Recommended Mitigation*
Implement a reward tracking system that accounts for balance changes over time:

## Snapshot-based rewards

* Store snapshots of user balances and global reward states when balances change
* Calculate rewards based on the time-weighted balance of users
* Update the earned() function to iterate through snapshots
