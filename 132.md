# Time Dilation Attack in Reward Distribution Mechanism


## Summary
A critical vulnerability in the SymmStaking contract allows attackers to perform a "time dilation attack" by exploiting the reward rate calculation mechanism. Through repeated minimal reward notifications, an attacker can exponentially decay reward rates and indefinitely extend reward periods, severely disrupting the protocol's economic model.


## Root Cause
The vulnerability arises from the reward rate recalculation logic in `_addRewardsForToken`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>>>        state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }
    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@>>>    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

Key issues:
1. Each call resets `periodFinish` regardless of amount
2. Rate recalculation allows tiny amounts to dilute existing rates
3. No minimum amount or time lock restrictions

## Internal pre-conditions
- Active reward distribution period
- No minimum reward amount validation
- No cooldown period between reward notifications
- Reward rate recalculation on every notification
- Period extension with every notification

## External pre-conditions
- Attacker has minimal amount of whitelisted reward token
- Contract is not paused
- Existing reward distribution is active

## Attack Path
1. Initial Setup:
   - Protocol adds legitimate rewards (e.g., 100,000 USDC for 7 days)
   - Initial rate = 100,000 USDC / (7 * 24 * 3600) â‰ˆ 0.165 USDC/second

2. Attack Execution:
   ```solidity
   // Daily attack loop
   for (uint i = 0; i < 28; i++) {
       // Add 1 wei of rewards
       notifyRewardAmount([USDC], [1]);
       // Wait 24 hours
       skip(1 days);
   }
   ```

3. Impact Progression:
   - Day 1: Rate = ~0.165 USDC/second
   - Day 7: Rate = ~0.066 USDC/second (60% reduction)
   - Day 28: Rate = ~0.005 USDC/second (97% reduction)

## Impact
 The attack results in:

1. Economic Impact:
   - Exponential decay of reward rates
   - Extension of reward period from 7 days to months
   - Disruption of expected APY calculations
  

2. Protocol Impact:
   - Loss of user trust
   - Inability to maintain reward schedules
   - Potential TVL collapse
   - Reputational damage


## Mitigation
1. Implement minimum reward amounts
2. Prevent period extension

```diff
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

+   require(amount >= MIN_REWARD_AMOUNT_FOR_TOKEN, "Reward amount too small");

    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
+       state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
-       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
+       state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining;
    }

    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
-   state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;

}
```
