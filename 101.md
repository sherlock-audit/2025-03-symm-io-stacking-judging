# Reward Rate Skew Due to Permissionless Deposits

### Summary

The **continuous update of `periodFinish`** in `_addRewardsForToken` allows **any user to manipulate the reward rate** by **adding small reward amounts**. Since the rate calculation depends on `duration`, frequent small deposits **lower the effective reward rate**, **reducing the expected rewards for stakers**.

### Root Cause

In `_addRewardsForToken`, every time a reward is added, the `periodFinish` is [extended](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378) by the `duration`.:

```solidity
state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
```

Since the reward rate is updated using:

```solidity
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
```

This means that

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. The function `notifyRewardAmount` is **permissionless**, meaning anyone can call it.
2. The contract allows **small reward deposits** without validation.

### External Pre-conditions


1. The staking pool relies on `state.rate` for reward distribution.
2. Attackers can submit multiple small transactions.

### Attack Path


1. **Initial state:**

   - 20 tokens added as rewards.
   - `periodFinish = block.timestamp + duration`.
   - `rate = amount / duration = 20 / 3600 = 0.005`.

2. **Attacker adds a small deposit (1 token) at `block.timestamp + 30 min`:**

   - Remaining time = `periodFinish - block.timestamp = 30 min`.
   - Leftover rewards = `remaining * rate = 10 tokens`.
   - New rate = `(amount + leftover) / duration = (1 + 10) / 3600 = 0.003`.
   - `periodFinish` **extends** by `duration`.

3. **Repeated attacks:**
   - The attacker **keeps depositing 1 token** every 30 minutes.
   - Each deposit skews the `rate` calculation **downward**.
   - Over time, **rewards distributed per second decrease**, reducing overall staker rewards.

### Impact


The **stakers suffer reduced rewards** as attackers manipulate the rate downward. The attacker **does not gain directly** but can **grief the system** and prevent fair reward distribution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. **Decouple `periodFinish` from new deposits**â€”only update it if the previous period has ended.
2. **Set a cooldown period** between reward updates to prevent frequent manipulation.
