# Lack of Access control in `deposit()` / `withdraw()` methods and inconsistency between two functions can lead to loss of funds for users

**Summary**
There is no validation regarding whether `receiver` and `msg.sender` are the same address in  deposit function, similarly in `withdraw` method no validation made on `to` address. There are also mismatches between two functions regarding tracking of staked amount and reward updates

**Vulnerability Details**
The [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234) and [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L250) methods are defined as:
```solidity
	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(receiver);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
		totalSupply += amount;
		balanceOf[receiver] += amount; //@receiver balance is increased
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
	}
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount); //the check is done on msg.sender
		totalSupply -= amount;
		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; //balance of msg.sender is decreased
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}
```
From the code above, both in `deposit()` and `withdraw()` there is no check if msg.sender is `receiver` and `to` respectively. There is a mismatch between two functions regarding balance tracking.  Deposit tracks balance under `receiver` while withdraw checks balance under `msg.sender`. Likewise deposit updates rewards under `receiver` while withdraw updates under `msg.sender`. Combining these with no validation of input may lead to different cases(explained below) that harm users.
**Case1**
Let's assume Bob stakes 604,800 tokens.

1. Bob unintentionally (a typo, copy-paste etc) pass in unintended `receiver` address, balance of receiver is increased, Bob calls withdraw() but can not withdraw due to `if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender])` check.
2.  Bob deposits succesfully but he may fall in the same mistake when withdraws. He unintentionally may pass in wrong `to` address, which will lead to loss of funds .

**Case2**
Bob calls deposit():

- amount:604,800 tokens
- receiver: address(bob1) , another address belong to Bob.

Bob calls withdraw() by passing `to==address(bob1)`. since the check in withdraw is done based on `msg.sender(bob)` and balanceOf[bob] = 0, he can't withdraw. bob1   can't withdraw because they never approved the contract
**Case3**
There are multiple stakers in the system. 
Bob stakes 604,800 tokens and after some time he calls `withdraw`. If Bob unintentionally (or intentionally*) pass in `to` address as one of the other stakers(let's say Alice), here is what happens:
 `amount` passed in is deducted from `Bob's balance` but it is transfered to `Alice`. The staked amount of Alice does not change and Alice gets tokens belongs to Bob while Bob loses his funds.

All the mentioned cases are very likely and the current implementation of the functions is  critically flawed and highly risky.
*Since there is no validation between `msg.sender` and `to`, Bob may think maliciously that if he pass in Alice's address immediately after the stake, he will withdraw staked amount belong to Alice so that he can get more rewards. However due to current implementation, Bob will be trapped and the tx will result in loss of funds for Bob
**Impacts**
Potential loss for stakers, Incorrect reward calculation

**Mitigation**
Sanitize the inputs  in both function. Create a consistent way of tracking balance of stakers
