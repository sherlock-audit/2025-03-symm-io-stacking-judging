# _resetVestingPlans Function’s amount Check Prevents Adjusting Vesting Plans

### Summary

In the Vesting contract, the _resetVestingPlans function checks amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount(), reverting if true. The intent is to prevent admins from affecting already unlocked user funds and ensure withdrawal security. However, after resetting, the function calls vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);, which recalculates the user’s vesting amount independently of unlockedAmount(). This check prevents admins from adjusting vestingPlan correctly, making resetVestingPlans unusable.

Additionally, this issue may impact the addLiquidityByPercentage function, preventing users from using locked tokens to gain liquidity fees, leading to financial losses. This makes it a high-risk issue.


### Root Cause

In [Vesting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231), the _resetVestingPlans function checks amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount(). If amount is less than the unlocked amount, it reverts, preventing admins from adjusting vestingPlan.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The _resetVestingPlans function in the Vesting contract is called.
2. vestingPlan.unlockedAmount() has accumulated some unlocked funds.
3. Attempts to adjust vestingPlan’s amount, but it is less than unlockedAmount().

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users calling addLiquidityByPercentage.

### Attack Path

1.	Initial State:
•	User A has a vesting plan that unlocks 100 tokens over time.
•	After some time, User A has already unlocked 70 tokens, with 30 tokens still locked.
2.	Admin Attempts to Adjust the Vesting Plan (or user attempts to call addLiquidityByPercentage):
•	Due to certain reasons, the admin wants to increase User A’s total vesting amount from 100 tokens to 110 tokens.
•	This means User A should have 40 tokens left to unlock.
•	The admin calls resetVestingPlans with 40 to update the vesting plan.
3.	Transaction Reverts:
•	The function checks require(amount >= vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()), where:
•	amount = 40
•	vestingPlan.unlockedAmount() = 70
•	Since 40 < 70, the check fails, and the transaction reverts, preventing the admin from making adjustments.
4.	Consequences:
•	The admin cannot adjust the vesting plan as intended, even if the new plan does not affect already claimed tokens.
•	If the admin wants to decrease the total vesting amount (e.g., adjusting it to 90 tokens, setting amount = 20), the check 20 < 70 also fails, making the change impossible.
•	Users may be unable to call addLiquidityByPercentage, as liquidity calculations rely on the vesting plan, leading to loss of liquidity rewards.

### Impact

Admins cannot adjust vestingPlan, making resetVestingPlans unusable.
Users may be unable to call addLiquidityByPercentage, leading to liquidity reward losses.
The inability to adjust vesting amounts reduces contract flexibility.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove require(amount >= vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()).
