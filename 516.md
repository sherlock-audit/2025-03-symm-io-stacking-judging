# `SymmVesting` contract fails to initialize

### Summary

`SymmVesting` contract inherits `Vesting` contract, and inside its `initialize` function, it calls `__vesting_init` function of `Vesting` contract, where both functions have `initializer` modifiers.

Since there exists `initializer` inside an `initializer`, the initialization reverts.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in [`__vesting_init`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76) function of the `Vesting` contract, where it uses `initializer` modifier.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- The `SymmVesting` contract initialization simply fails.

### Impact

Failure in initialization of the `SymmVesting` contract.

### PoC

```solidity
    modifier initializer() {
        // solhint-disable-next-line var-name-mixedcase
        InitializableStorage storage $ = _getInitializableStorage();

        // Cache values to avoid duplicated sloads
        bool isTopLevelCall = !$._initializing;
        uint64 initialized = $._initialized;

        // Allowed calls:
        // - initialSetup: the contract is not in the initializing state and no previous version was
        //                 initialized
        // - construction: the contract is initialized at version 1 (no reininitialization) and the
        //                 current contract is just being deployed
        bool initialSetup = initialized == 0 && isTopLevelCall;
        bool construction = initialized == 1 && address(this).code.length == 0;

        if (!initialSetup && !construction) {
            revert InvalidInitialization();
        }
        $._initialized = 1;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            $._initializing = true;
        }
        _;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            $._initializing = false;
            emit Initialized(1);
        }
    }
```

Here's the `initializer` modifier implementation.

- During the first `initializer` modifier of `SymmStaking` contract, `initialized` and `initializing` are set to true.
- When `initializer` modifier is called inside `Vesting` contract again, `initialSetup = false`, `construction = false`.
- Thus it reverts with `InvalidInitialization` error.

### Mitigation

The `__vesting_init` function of `Vesting` contract should use `onlyInitializing` modifier instead.
