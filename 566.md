# Precision Loss in SymmStaking Contract

### Summary

The `SymmStaking` contract will cause a cumulative loss of funds for the protocol as integer truncation in rate calculations will result in unrewarded tokens over time.
Integer truncation in reward rate calculations will cause a cumulative loss of funds for the protocol as the contract's arithmetic operations truncate decimal values during reward calculations, leading to a direct loss of funds over time with each reward distribution cycle

### Root Cause

every time notified reword we need to call :
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
		@>	state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
		@>	state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
```
the rate represents reword per second so will be pression lose  per second .

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `notifyRewardAmount()` to set reward amount for a token (e.g., WBTC, USDC, or USDT)
2. The reward duration (`state.duration`) must be set to a value that causes division truncation (e.g., 7 days = 604,800 seconds)

### External Pre-conditions

non

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `notifyRewardAmount()` to set a reward of 1 WBTC over 7 days
2. The contract calculates `state.rate` as `amount / state.duration`, truncating the decimal part: it a 9 decemales token 
   - For WBTC: 165.343915343915343915 becomes 165, resulting in a loss of 0.343915343915343915 WBTC per second
3. Stakers deposit funds and earn rewards based on the truncated rate
4. Over time, the precision loss accumulates:
   - For WBTC: A total loss of approximately 0.00208 WBTC over 7 days
5. If this occurs during many distributions, the cumulative loss becomes significant:


### Impact

*The protocol suffers an approximate loss of 0.00208 WBTC per reward distribution over 7 days.*
even with usdc or usdt 
This loss is cumulative: If the protocol distributes multiple rewards over time, the total loss can become significant. For example, if the protocol distributes rewards 100 times, 

### PoC

```typescript
it("should demonstrate precision loss in reward rate calculation", async function () {
  // This test demonstrates the precision loss issue in the SymmStaking contract
  // where integer truncation in rate calculation leads to a loss of funds over time

  // Deploy a mock WBTC token for testing
  const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20")
  const wbtcToken = await ERC20.connect(admin).deploy("WBTC", "WBTC")
  await wbtcToken.waitForDeployment()

  // User1 deposits SYMM tokens
  const depositAmount = e("100")
  await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
  await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

  // Admin configures WBTC as a reward token
  await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await wbtcToken.getAddress(), true)

  // Set reward amount and duration
  // Using 1 WBTC (1e8 units) over 7 days (604,800 seconds) as mentioned in the audit report
  const rewardAmount = ethers.parseUnits("1", 8) // 1 WBTC with 8 decimals
  const rewardDuration = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 7 days in seconds (604,800)

  // Admin mints and approves reward amount
  const mintFunction = wbtcToken.getFunction("mint")
  await mintFunction.call(wbtcToken.connect(admin), admin.address, rewardAmount)
  await wbtcToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
  await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await wbtcToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

  // Get the reward state after notifying rewards
  const tokenRewardStateAfter = await symmStaking.rewardState(await wbtcToken.getAddress())

  // Calculate the expected rate without truncation (using BigInt for precision)
  // rate = amount / duration
  const expectedRateWithoutTruncation = rewardAmount * BigInt(1e27) / BigInt(rewardDuration)

  // Get the actual rate from the contract
  const actualRate = tokenRewardStateAfter.rate

  // Calculate the difference (precision loss)
  const precisionLoss = expectedRateWithoutTruncation - actualRate

  // Calculate the total rewards that would be distributed with the truncated rate
  const totalRewardsWithTruncation = actualRate * BigInt(rewardDuration) / BigInt(1e27)

  // Calculate the difference between the original reward amount and what will actually be distributed
  const totalLoss = rewardAmount - totalRewardsWithTruncation

  console.log(`Reward Amount: ${ethers.formatUnits(rewardAmount, 8)} WBTC`)
  console.log(`Expected Rate Without Truncation: ${expectedRateWithoutTruncation}`)
  console.log(`Actual Rate (After Truncation): ${actualRate}`)
  console.log(`Precision Loss in Rate: ${precisionLoss}`)
  console.log(`Total Loss Over Duration: ${ethers.formatUnits(totalLoss, 8)} WBTC`)

  // Verify that there is precision loss in the rate calculation
  expect(precisionLoss).to.be.gt(0)

  // Verify that the total rewards distributed will be less than the original reward amount
  expect(totalLoss).to.be.gt(0)

  // The loss should be measurable, even if small
  // The actual loss percentage is around 0.000001%, which is small but accumulates over time
  expect((Number(totalLoss) * 100) / Number(rewardAmount)).to.be.gt(0) // Any loss is problematic when it accumulates
})
```

### Mitigation

 **Use Higher Precision Arithmetic:**
   - Scale up calculations by a higher factor before division and scale down afterward to preserve decimal precision.
   - Example: Increase PRECISION_FACTOR from 1e27 to a higher value.
