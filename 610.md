# Unnecessary requirement check can result in failure to add liquidity for the 2nd or subsequent times

## Summary
If staker is adding liquidity for the 2nd or subsequent time, an unnecessary requirement check in `_resetVestingPlans()` can cause the function to fail, not allowing staker to add liquidity again.

## Root Cause
This requirement check can lead to revert, even if user has enough locked SYMM_LP tokens to be vested.

## Vulnerability Details
Assume this scenario whereby Alice is adding liquidity for a second time. Hence, Alice has an existing vesting plan for SYMM LP token.

1. Alice calls `addLiquidity()` function in SYMMVesting.sol, passing amount as 40e18 SYMM tokens
2. `_addLiquidityProcess()` is called
3. Unlocked SYMM tokens is claimed via `claimUnlockedToken()`
4. `_addLiquidity()` is called. In this function, `addLiquidityProportional()` is now called, interacting with Balancer pool.
5. Assume the function has transferred 20e18 worth of SYMM LP tokens to SymmVesting.sol 
6. Since this is Alice's 2nd time adding liquidity, assume her existing unlocked tokens for her SYMM LP vesting plan = 30e18, and locked tokens = 5e18
7. Now, `claimUnlockedToken()` is called again, this time to claim Alice's unlocked SYMM LP tokens, which is 30e18
8. amounts[0] = lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount = 5e18 + 20e18 = 25e18
9. `_resetVestingPlans()` is now called, passing 25e18 as amounts
10. In `_resetVestingPlans()`, since amount which is 25e18 is less than unlocked amount which is 30e18, function will revert.

## Impact
Stakers who wish to add liquidity for the 2nd and subsequent times will have a high-medium likelihood that the process will fail, due to this unnecessary check. Even when stakers have enough locked SYMM LP tokens to be vested, they cannot proceed with the vesting.
