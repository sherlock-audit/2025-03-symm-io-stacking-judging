# Any user will overwrite existing rewards when adding new rewards

### Summary

When a new reward is added halfway through a period, the `_updateRewardsStates` function is called, which updates the user's earned rewards and then sets `userRewardPerTokenPaid` to the current `perTokenStored` value. However, this effectively "resets" the user's reward calculation for the ongoing period, causing them to lose the accumulated rewards.

### Root Cause

The issue is that when you call `rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token)`, you're overwriting the user's accumulated rewards rather than adding to them.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A new reward is added whilst an existing reward period is still in effect

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

See summary

### Impact

User losses expected rewards causing finacial loss and lack of confidence in the protocol.  Also rewards will get locked in the system and can only be rescued by the protocol Admin.  BTW. Any user can add rewards, not just the Admin

### PoC

```Typescript
it.only("new rewards overwrite existing rewards clearing unclaimed rewards POC", async function () {
			// Give user2 some USDT
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(user2.address, 604800)

			const depositAmount = "604800" // user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM
			const rewardAmount = "604800" // Total reward for 7 days

			// user1 deposits tokens
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			// Admin configures and notifies rewards
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			// Fast forward time to accumulate some rewards
			await time.increase(302400)

			// More rewards added to incentivise staking
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1209600)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [1209600])

			// Fast forward time to the end of the new reward period
			await time.increase(302400)

			// User 1 claims rewards at the end of the initial period
			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)

			// The claimed rewards should be 604800 (all of first reward) + 604800 (half of the second reward)
			// expect(user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore).to.equal("604802")
			console.log("First claimed rewards: ", user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore) // actual 907200

			await time.increase(302400) // got to end of both rewards

			const user1BalanceBefore1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter1 = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)

			// The claimed rewards should be 604800 the remaining half of the second reward
			// expect(user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1).to.equal(rewardAmount)
			console.log("Second claimed rewards:", user1BalanceAfter1 - user1BalanceBefore1) // actual 604800

			// total reward at end of both periods should be 1209600 + 604800 = 1814400
			const totalReward = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			console.log("Total reward:", totalReward) // actual 1814400 (302400 was lost)
		})
```

### Mitigation

```Solidity
function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = rewardTokens[i];
        TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

        state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
        state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

        if (account != address(0)) {
            // Calculate new earnings since last update
            uint256 newEarnings = ((balanceOf[account] * 
                (rewardPerToken(token) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token])) / 1e18);
            
            // Add new earnings to existing rewards
            if (newEarnings > 0) {
                rewards[account][token] += newEarnings;
            }
            
            // Update the paid marker
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

This change ensures that when a new reward is added, the user's previously accumulated rewards are preserved, and only the new earnings since the last update are added.
