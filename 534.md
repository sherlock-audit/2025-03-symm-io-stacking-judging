# A reward token can't be removed because of pendingRewards[] check in SymmStaking.sol

### Summary

The below check in `configureRewardToken()` will not allow admin to remove a rewards token because if there are just > 10 wei of undistributed rewards in the contract, the method will revert.
```solidity
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Root Cause

The mapping `pendingRewards` only decreases when the rewards are claimed by the user. When the `totalSupply = 0` for the time being, the rewards are not distributed.  Considering the pending rewards just need to be > 10 wei makes it very likely that the `configureRewardToken()` will revert.

For example: If total rewards to be distributed is 1000e6 USDC, that will be distributed for the time span of `1 weeks`. Then the reward rate becomes 1653 wei per second. So, even for a second in the whole staking period if `totalSupply = 0` then there will be atleast `pendingRewards = 1653 wei` left at the end of the period.

The admin can withdraw the undistributed rewards with `rescueTokens()` method but it'll not set `pendingRewards = 0`. Which means this reward token can never be removed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

The protocol is unable to remove a reward token because `pendingRewards` include undistributed rewards.

### Impact

For any reason if the protocol wants to remove a reward token, they can't do it because the `configureRewardToken()` will keep reverting with `OngoingRewardPeriodForToken` error.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the reward pending is finished, refund the undistributed rewards, so `pendingRewards` can be reset to 0.
