# Reward manager in `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` can remove ongoing reward tokens, causing loss of rewards for stakers

### Summary

The `configureRewardToken` function incorrectly checks pendingRewards[token] > 10 instead of verifying if the reward period is still active (`block.timestamp < periodFinish`). This allows a reward manager to remove a token while its reward period is ongoing, leading to users not receiving their due rewards. Additionally, even small unclaimed rewards (≤10 wei) can become trapped, making them irrecoverable.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol`, the function `configureRewardToken(address token, bool status)` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312-L335) only checks if `pendingRewards[token] > 10` before allowing a token to be removed.

This does not ensure that the token's reward period is finished (`block.timestamp >= rewardState[token].periodFinish)`.

As a result, the function allows removal of a reward token even when it is still distributing rewards, preventing users from claiming their full rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `Reward Manager` needs to call `configureRewardToken(token, false)` while `pendingRewards[token] ≤ 10`.
2. `rewardState[token].periodFinish` must be greater than `block.timestamp` (i.e., the reward period is still active).
3. Stakers must have accrued unclaimed rewards in the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A reward token must have been added to the system and is actively being distributed.
2. Stakers must have deposited and are eligible to receive the rewards from the given reward token.

### Attack Path

1. `Reward Manager` calls `configureRewardToken(token, false)` while `pendingRewards[token] ≤ 10`, even though the reward period is ongoing.
2. The token is removed as a valid reward token, even though `rewardState[token].periodFinish > block.timestamp`.
3. Users who staked expecting the reward token are unable to claim their due rewards.
4. Small amounts of pending rewards (≤10 wei) become permanently trapped in the contract.

### Impact

Stakers lose expected rewards because a reward token can be removed before its period has finished.

Funds get stuck: Small unclaimed rewards (≤10 wei) become unrecoverable, leading to loss of funds.

Protocol credibility is harmed, as users may distrust the fairness of reward distribution.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assuming token "XYZ" is a valid reward token with ongoing distribution
// An attacker (Reward Manager) removes it before the period finishes

// Deploy staking contract and configure XYZ as a reward token
stakingContract.configureRewardToken(XYZ, true);

// Add rewards for XYZ
stakingContract.notifyRewardAmount(XYZ, 1000 ether);

// A staker deposits and expects rewards
stakingContract.deposit(10 ether, msg.sender);

// Attacker removes XYZ before reward period ends
stakingContract.configureRewardToken(XYZ, false);

// Staker tries to claim rewards, but XYZ is no longer a valid reward token
stakingContract.claimRewards(); // Fails, rewards are lost
```

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, modify `configureRewardToken` to check if the reward period is finished before allowing removal:
```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(status || block.timestamp >= rewardState[token].periodFinish, "Cannot remove active reward token");
    require(status || pendingRewards[token] == 0, "Pending rewards must be claimed");
    
    isRewardToken[token] = status;
    emit RewardTokenConfigured(token, status);
}
```
