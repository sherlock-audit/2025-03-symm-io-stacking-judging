# Lack of forceApproval() to 0 results in revert while addLiquidity()

### Summary

In some tokens like USDT , include an approval race protection mechanism, requiring the allowance to be set to 0 before calling the `approve` function again.

After adding the liquidity to balanceV3 pool the approval amount is not changed back to 0. This will cause to revert when addLiquidity() is called next time. Or using the forceApprove() would be the better choice.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L185-L206

Usage of approve() instead of forceApprove().

### Internal Pre-conditions

USDT - SYMM pool

### External Pre-conditions

 ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional() cannot utilise the entire USDT that has been approved

### Attack Path

User called addLiquidity() to take locked SYMM tokens and add it to the balanbcer V3 pool.
SInce its trying to approve a value when approval is already > 0 , it will revert.

### Impact

Reverts while adding the liquidity to the balancerV3 pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use forceApprove() instead of approve()
