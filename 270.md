# Significant precision loss when calculating reward tokens rate

### Summary

The rate is calculated as `state.rate = amount / state.duration;`. When the reward token is a low decimals token, the precision is error is significant. For example, when the duration is 1 week, the loss goes up to `7*24*3600 - 1 = 0.6 USD`. The bigger the duration, the bigger the loss. A duration of a few months exceeds 10 USD, or 1 week losses for a few months. Although tokens can be rescued, users still lose in the meantime.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking:370` and `SymmStaking:374`, [no precision](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370-L374) is added.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

Low decimal reward token (such as $USDT).

### Attack Path

1. Rewards are added through `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()`.
2. Rate suffers precision loss and a significant amount of tokens is not distributed.

### Impact

Yield loss for stakers which exceeds 10 USD.

### PoC

See summary.

### Mitigation

Multiply by 1e18 in the rate itself.
