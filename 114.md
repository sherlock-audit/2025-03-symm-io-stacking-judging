# No single reward token claim functionality prevents some users from claiming rewards

### Summary

The `SymmStaking.sol` contract does not have a function to claim rewards for a single token but loops through all at once instead. Due to this, some users will not be able to claim any part of their rewards.

### Root Cause

Users stake tokens inside `SymmStaking` to earn rewards. When users [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385-L400), it loops through all reward tokens and pays them out:

```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

The protocol will work with multiple stablecoins like [USDC, USDT, USDE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate). 

If the user claiming rewards is blacklisted on either USDC or USDT when they are a reward token, the user will be unable to claim any of their rewards since no function exists to claim yield for a single token. This leads to complete loss of rewards for the user. 

Due to the way reward claims work, if a pausable token is added as reward token and a pause is initiated, NO users will be able to claim rewards for any of the rewards tokens either, for as long as it's paused.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

User blacklisted on USDC/USDT

### Attack Path

No attack path

### Impact

User will be unable to claim any of their rewards since no function exists to claim yield for a single token. Complete loss of rewards for the user. 

Although there is a rule in the sherlock judging which states that issues about a user getting blacklisted by a token only causing harm to themselves are invalid, in this context, the user will not be able to claim ANY reward tokens and not only the blacklisted token, which should be the case. Therefore, I believe the issue is valid and of medium severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either implement try/catch in the logic to claim, or allow users to claim rewards for a specific token.
