# Anyone can delay rewards distribution

### Summary

In `SymmStaking` contract, `notifyRewardAmount` function is an open to public that everyone can call it.
Some malicious users can delay rewards distribution by calling this function with 1 wei of reward tokens.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) function, where it can be called by malicious users with dust amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Specific rewards have been distributed and it's in process of distribution.

### External Pre-conditions

A malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount` with dust amount of rewards.

### Attack Path

- The staked tokens accrued rewards, and say 10,000 USDC has been deposited as rewards and say 3.5 days have passed.
- Since rewards distribution period is 1 week, 5,000 USDC should have been distributed.
- The remaining 5,000 USDC should be distributed in remaining 3.5 days.
- Malicious Alice calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 wei of USDC token as rewards.
- As a result, remaining 5,000 USDC will be distributed in next 7 days.

### Impact

Delay of user rewards distribution.

### PoC
