# [Medium] Unrestricted Minting of SYMM Tokens

### Summary

The lack of access control in the minting function will cause an uncontrolled inflation of token supply for all SYMM holders as users with vesting plans will trigger arbitrary minting through the liquidity addition process

### Root Cause

In contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol: the _mintTokenIfPossible function allows unrestricted minting of SYMM tokens without proper verification that the tokens represent actual transferred assets:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L258-L260

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have a vesting plan with locked SYMM tokens in the SymmVesting contract
2. Contract needs to have insufficient SYMM balance compared to the requested operation amount
3. The specific implementation of _ensureSufficientBalance needs to call _mintTokenIfPossible when balance is insufficient

### External Pre-conditions

SYMM token must be configured to allow minting by the SymmVesting contract

### Attack Path

1. User (Alice) establishes a vesting plan with 1,000,000 locked SYMM tokens in the vesting contract
2. The SymmVesting contract has zero or insufficient SYMM tokens on hand (much less than 1,000,000)
3. Alice calls `addLiquidity(1,000,000, 0, 1e9)` to use her locked tokens
4. Inside the process, `_ensureSufficientBalance` detects the contract doesn't have enough SYMM
5. The contract mints 1,000,000 new SYMM tokens to itself through _mintTokenIfPossible
6. The liquidity addition completes using newly minted tokens rather than pre-existing tokens
7. Alice's vesting records are updated, but the total SYMM supply has now increased by 1,000,000

### Impact

The protocol suffers from uncontrolled token inflation beyond intended supply caps. All token holders experience value dilution as new tokens are minted without corresponding asset backing. The attacker gains LP tokens backed by newly minted tokens rather than pre-existing ones.

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vestingContract.addLiquidity(1_000_000 * 1e18, 0, 1e30);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // Verify new tokens were minted
        uint256 newSupply = IMintableERC20(vestingContract.SYMM()).totalSupply();
        assertGt(newSupply, initialSupply);
        assertEq(newSupply - initialSupply, 1_000_000 * 1e18);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement access control on the minting function, restricting it to administrative roles only
2. Ensure vesting plans are only created when actual tokens have been transferred to the contract
3. Verify contract balances match vesting records before allowing operations like liquidity provision
4. Implement supply caps to prevent unlimited minting
5. Change the design to ensure tokens are transferred from external wallets before being considered "locked" in vesting plans
