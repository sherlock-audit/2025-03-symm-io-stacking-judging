# Missing validation of endTime > startTime and startTime greater than current time in _setupVestingPlans function

## Summary

The `_setupVestingPlans` function in the provided Solidity smart contract is responsible for setting up token vesting plans for multiple users. However, it currently lacks a crucial validation check to ensure that the `endTime` is greater than the `startTime`. This omission could lead to invalid vesting schedulesã€‚


## Vulnerability Detail

The `_setupVestingPlans` function iterates through the array of user addresses and the corresponding array of token amounts to configure the vesting plan. The function checks that the lengths of the `users` and `amounts` arrays match, but does not verify that `endTime` is greater than `startTime` or that `startTime` is greater than the current time. This omission could result in an unreasonable or invalid time range for the attribution plan, i.e., the end time is before the start time, or the start time is before the current time.


## Impact

- **Medium**: when the `unlockedAmount` function is called it returns the full unlocked amount because the current time is greater than the endtime and the user can unlock all tokens early.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
	/// @notice Sets up vesting plans for multiple users.
	/// @dev Reverts if the users and amounts arrays have different lengths.
	/// @param token Address of the token.
	/// @param startTime Vesting start time.
	/// @param endTime Vesting end time.
	/// @param users Array of user addresses.
	/// @param amounts Array of token amounts.
	function setupVestingPlans(
		address token,
		uint256 startTime,
		uint256 endTime,
		address[] memory users,
		uint256[] memory amounts
	) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        @audit-issue No check was made to see if the endtime is greater than the startime.
		_setupVestingPlans(token, startTime, endTime, users, amounts);
	}
```

The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation to ensure that endTime is greater than startTime and startTime >= block.timestamp

## Conclusion

The `_setupVestingPlans` function lacks basic validation to ensure that endTime is greater than startTime and startTime >= block.timestamp. Without this check, contracts may create vesting plans with unreasonable or invalid schedules.


## Recommendations

Add Validation:
```solidity
	/// @notice Sets up vesting plans for multiple users.
	/// @dev Reverts if the users and amounts arrays have different lengths.
	/// @param token Address of the token.
	/// @param startTime Vesting start time.
	/// @param endTime Vesting end time.
	/// @param users Array of user addresses.
	/// @param amounts Array of token amounts.
	function setupVestingPlans(
		address token,
		uint256 startTime,
		uint256 endTime,
		address[] memory users,
		uint256[] memory amounts
	) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        @Fix   require(endTime>startTime && startTime >= block.timestamp,"error")
		_setupVestingPlans(token, startTime, endTime, users, amounts);
	}
```
Introduce a check at the beginning of the function to ensure endTime > startTime and startTime >= block.timestamp.
Revert with a descriptive error message if the condition is not met.
