# Fee-On-Transfer Token Incompatibility during Reward distribution

## Summary: 

If Fee on transfer tokens were used as reward tokens, the reward distribution via `notifyRewardAmount()` fails to account for fee-on-transfer tokens leading to contract insolvency. 


## Description: 

The implementation of function `notifyRewardAmount()`  assumes the transferred amount equals the received amount:
[#notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L285)
```Solidity 
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
.......
			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
			
.....
```

This discrepancy creates an accounting mismatch where the contract records rewards based on pre-fee amounts while actually holding post-fee balances. 

The reward rate calculation uses the full amount without considering potential transfer fees, leading to an overestimation of available rewards.


## Impact: 

- Contract becomes insolvent for FOT tokens.
- Last user cannot claim any rewards for that token.


## Recommendation: 

Modify `_notifyRewardAmount()` to use post-transfer balance.
