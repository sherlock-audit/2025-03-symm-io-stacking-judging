# [M-11] No Validation of ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional Return Values

## Summary

The contract doesn't properly validate return values from the `ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional` function call, creating a risk of undetected failures during liquidity addition operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In SymmVesting.sol:196-202, the contract calls the external `addLiquidityProportional` function but doesn't properly validate its success beyond checking the received LP token amount:

Code reference: SymmVesting.sol#L196-L202 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L196-L202

```solidity
amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
    address(POOL),
    amountsIn,
    expectedLpAmount,
    false, // wethIsEth: bool
    "" // userData: bytes
);
```

The issue is that:

1. The function assigns the return value of `addLiquidityProportional` to the `amountsIn` variable, overwriting the input values
2. However, there's no validation that the operation was actually successful before this assignment
3. While there is a slippage check later in the function (line 212), it only verifies the LP token amount received, not whether the operation succeeded in using the correct token amounts
4. A partial success or subtle failure could occur where the liquidity addition seemingly works but doesn't use the expected proportions of tokens or has other unexpected behavior

This happens in the `_addLiquidity` function, which is used by several other functions:
- `addLiquidity` (line 103)
- `addLiquidityFor` (line 120)
- `swapLockedForLp` (line 138)

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

1. **Silent Failures**: Partial failures in the liquidity addition process might go undetected, especially if they still result in some LP tokens being issued.

2. **Token Loss**: If the router uses different token proportions than expected, users might contribute more tokens than necessary without proper compensation.

3. **Accounting Inconsistencies**: The contract might track inaccurate token amounts if the actual amounts used differ from what the contract expects.

4. **Failed Operations**: In extreme cases, complete failures might be missed, resulting in users believing their liquidity addition was successful when it wasn't.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// SymmVesting.sol:196-202
amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
    address(POOL),
    amountsIn,
    expectedLpAmount,
    false, // wethIsEth: bool
    "" // userData: bytes
);

// Return unused usdc
if (usdcIn - amountsIn[1] > 0) usdc.safeTransfer(msg.sender, usdcIn - amountsIn[1]);

// Calculate actual LP tokens received by comparing balances.
uint256 newLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));
lpAmount = newLpBalance - initialLpBalance;

if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add comprehensive validation of the `addLiquidityProportional` operation:

1. **Check Return Status**: If the router provides a boolean success indicator, check it explicitly:

```solidity
(bool success, uint256[] memory actualAmountsIn) = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(...);
if (!success) revert LiquidityAdditionFailed();
amountsIn = actualAmountsIn;
```

2. **Validate Token Proportions**: If the router doesn't provide a success indicator, add additional checks for expected behavior:

```solidity
uint256[] memory expectedAmounts = new uint256[](2);
expectedAmounts[0] = symmIn;
expectedAmounts[1] = usdcIn;

// Call router
amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(...);

// Validate that the operation used expected amounts within a reasonable threshold
uint256 symmDifference = expectedAmounts[0] - amountsIn[0];
uint256 usdcDifference = expectedAmounts[1] - amountsIn[1];
if (symmDifference > expectedAmounts[0] * 5 / 100) revert UnexpectedTokenConsumption();  // >5% difference
```

3. **Explicit Error Handling**: Add specific error types for different failure modes:

```solidity
error LiquidityAdditionFailed();
error UnexpectedTokenConsumption();
error InsufficientLPTokensReceived();
```

These changes would improve error detection and provide more specific feedback when liquidity addition operations don't behave as expected.
