# Unsafe ERC20 Transfers Leading to Silent Failures (Vesting)




## Summary
The Vesting contract use the  transferfor ERC20 token transfer without verifying the return value and a non-compliant ERC20 tokens (USDT) return false on failure instead of reverting leading to silent transaction success even when transfer fail. This cause the state inconsistencies as tokens marked as claimed but never sent

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L261-L275


## Vulnerability Details

When a user claim unlocked tokens through the _claimUnlockedToken function, the contract will:
     1. Calculate claimableAmount as tokens unlocked but not yet claimed.
     2. then deduct claimableAmount from totalVested[token].
     3. and update vestingPlan.claimedAmount.
     4. calling the IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount).
      
When a user claim locked tokens through the _claimLockedToken, the contract:
     1. Transfer amount - penalty
 to the user.
     2. Transfer penalty to lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver.
     3. But both transfers still use transfer without checking the success.
```solidity
   function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
       // ...... 
       IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty); //@audit: Unsafe transfer
       IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty); //@audit: Unsafe transfer
   }
```
The transfer method does return a bool indicating success but If a token like USDT return false on failure, the transaction does not revert leaving the contract state inconsistent with actual token balances.



## Proof of Concept (PoC) 
1. A USDT is a non-reverting ERC20 token that return false on failure and the vesting Contract is with USDT as the vesting token but bob as a user who is blacklisted by USDT s sanctioned address 

2. Bob has a vesting plan with amount = 1000 USDT, startTime in the past and endTime in the future then at the time of the claim is  claimableAmount = 500 USDT.

3. Bob call the claimUnlockedToken() to claim his 500 USDT.
   - The contract calculate the claimableAmount = 500 USDT and update it with:
     - totalVested[USDT] -= 500 USDT
     - vestingPlan.claimedAmount += 500 USDT
   - The contract want to send 500 USDT to Bob using transfer method but because Alice is blacklisted, The transfer return false and the transaction didn't revert.

4. so bob claimedAmount is now 500 USDT marked as claimed as the totalVested[USDT] says it  is reduced by 500 USDT believing tokens are  withdrawn and bob will receive 0 USDT but the contract state still show that he claimed his tokens.

5. meaning that Bob lose access to 500 USDT permanently and the contract accounting become inconsistent with the actual token balances.


## Impact 

1. The transfer method does not revert for non-compliant tokenscausing transactions to succeed despite failed transfers.
2. The contract accounting claimedAmount and totalVested become out of sync with actual token balances.
3. User or the protocol lose access to tokens permanently due to incorrect state updates.


## Recommendation
replace  transfer call with safeTransfer from OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 library to ensure failed transfer revert the transaction.
