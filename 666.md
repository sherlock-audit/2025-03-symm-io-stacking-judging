# `addLiquidity` lacks user inputted deadline parameter

## Vulnerability Details

Currently when adding liquidity, user can provide minLpAmount and maxUsdcIn as form of slippages. However, there is missing user inputted deadline available.

This means in the event of L2 congestion, the transaction can be stuck in the mempool and be exceuted after a long time after transaction is initially called. During this time, the pool balances in the Balancer pool can change and the slippage parameters can be come outadated and the liquidity addition can be unfavourable for the user

## Root Cause
Lack of deadline parameter in liquidity addition

## Impact 
Outdated slippage parameters used can lead to unfavourable liqudity additions for user

## Mitigation

Consider allowing user to pass in a user inputted deadline.
