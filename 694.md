# Fixed Threshold Precision Error Prevents Reward Token Unwhitelisting

### Summary
A fixed threshold check (`pendingRewards[token] > 10`) prevents unwhitelisting of reward tokens even when only a negligible (dusty) reward amount is present. This can block configuration updates and lock tokens in the system, as an attacker or operator may be unable to remove tokens that have trivial pending rewards due to their decimal representation.

### Finding Description
In the `configureRewardToken` function, before a token is removed from the whitelist, there is a check:

```solidity
if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
This check is intended to prevent the removal of tokens that still have rewards pending. However, because pendingRewards is stored in raw token units (e.g., USDC has 6 decimals), even a minuscule amount like 0.002 USDC is represented as 2000 (0.002 Ã— 10^6). Since 2000 is much greater than 10, the condition always fails, even for a "dusty" reward. As a result, tokens that should be unwhitelisted become locked indefinitely, preventing any configuration changes.

### Impact
- **Operational Disruption**: Administrators cannot remove reward tokens from the whitelist when even a small residual exists, locking those tokens in the system.
- **User/Protocol Inconvenience**: The inability to update token configurations can hinder maintenance, upgrades, or changes in the reward system, causing frustration and potential economic inefficiencies.
- **Risk of Stale Configurations**: Over time, the accumulation of negligible rewards could block the recovery or reconfiguration of reward tokens that are no longer desired, leading to a buildup of stale, non-functional reward configurations.
### PoC

```solidity
	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			//@audit hardcoded threshold
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
	
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```
### Recommendation
**Adjust Threshold for Decimals**:
Replace the fixed threshold of 10 with a value that accounts for the token's decimals. For example, if the intent is to allow unwhitelisting when rewards are less than `0.01 USDC`, compute the threshold as:
```solidity
uint256 threshold = 0.01 * (10 ** tokenDecimals);
```
