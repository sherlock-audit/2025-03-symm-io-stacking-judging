# Vesting commences immediately & vesting duration is extended if restVestingPlans() is called before startTime

## Description
If `resetVestingPlans() --> resetAmount()` is called **_before_** the original `startTime`, it gets overwritten to a longer duration & the [vesting duration commences immediately](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L77). 
For example:
1. Original plan: 9-month vesting with `startTime` at `T` and `endTime` at `T+9 months`
2. If reset at `T-1 month` (before starting): New plan starts immediately and ends at `current + 10 months`
```solidity
	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);  <---- this returns the remaining duration from current time which is greater than `endTime - startTime`
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
		self.startTime = block.timestamp;             <---- this causes the vesting startTime to commence immediately
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;   <---- this causes the vesting duration to be longer than intended
		self.amount = amount;
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}
```

and 

```solidity
	function remainingDuration(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (uint256) {
		return self.endTime > block.timestamp ? self.endTime - block.timestamp : 0;
	}
```

## Impact
While the overwriting of `startTime` is okay if `resetVestingPlans()` is called once vesting period has started, doing so in the above case gives rise to two issues:
1. Admin has no way to change the vested amount without causing the vesting to commence immediately instead of the prior planned `startTime` AND causing the vesting duration to increase by an amount of `startTime - currentTime`.

2. The second issue is one similar to yet a distinct vulnerability which has been reported separately under the title `"User can unlock tokens before schedule due to vesting error in addLiquidityProcess()"`. That needs to be fixed in conjunction with this one. That issue allows user to unlock tokens ahead of time via `SYMM_LP` vesting if their `SYMM` vesting schedule is due to start in the future. Note that even if that other issue is fixed, a user can:
    - first call `addLiquidity()` with a small amount (or zero). ( If in the other issue the `_setupVestingPlans()` parameter setting vulnerability is fixed inside `_addLiquidityProcess()` then `startTime` gets set properly )
    - then user calls `addLiquidity()` again with entire locked `SYMM` amount which [this time calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L155-L156) `_resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts)` and resets the `lpVestingPlan.startTime` to current timestamp, causing the impact from our current vulnerability.

## Mitigation 
Make the following change to avoid disturbing the vesting start & end if called before `startTime`:
```diff
	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
+     if (self.startTime <= block.timestamp) {
		self.startTime = block.timestamp;           
		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
+     }
		self.amount = amount;
		self.claimedAmount = 0;
		return self;
	}
```
