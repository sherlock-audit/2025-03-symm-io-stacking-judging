# Precision Loss in Reward Calculations Undermines User Rewards

### Summary


The use of integer division in reward calculations will cause a financial loss for stakers as the protocol will underpay their expected rewards due to precision truncation.



### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol:205, the rewardPerToken function uses integer division, which truncates fractional values, leading to precision loss in reward calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions


Users need to stake SYMM tokens to set totalSupply to be at least 1 token to enable reward calculations.
Reward manager needs to call notifyRewardAmount to set rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate to be at least 1 wei to initiate reward distribution.
The time elapsed since the last reward update (lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated) needs to be at least 1 second to trigger a reward calculation.


### External Pre-conditions

None required, as this issue is internal to the contract's logic.

### Attack Path

User stakes a small amount of SYMM tokens (e.g., 100 SYMM) via the deposit function, increasing totalSupply to 100.
Reward manager calls notifyRewardAmount to distribute rewards, setting rate = 1 for a reward token.
After 1 second, the rewardPerToken function calculates the reward increase as (1 * 1 * 1e18) / 100 = 1e16, truncating any fractional rewards below this precision.
User calls earned to check their rewards, receiving less than expected due to the truncated precision.
User claims rewards via claimRewards, receiving fewer tokens than mathematically entitled, with the loss accumulating over time.

### Impact


The stakers suffer an approximate loss of up to 0.01% of their expected rewards due to precision loss. The protocol does not gain or lose tokens, but user trust and satisfaction are undermined.



### PoC

Below is a coded PoC demonstrating the precision loss issue in rewardPerToken. This can be run in a testing environment like Foundry to verify the vulnerability.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract SymmStakingPrecisionTest is Test {
    SymmStaking staking;

    address user = address(0x1);
    address rewardToken = address(0x2);

    function setUp() public {
        staking = new SymmStaking();
        staking.initialize(address(this), address(0x3)); // stakingToken
        staking.configureRewardToken(rewardToken, true);
    }

    function testPrecisionLoss() public {
        // User stakes 100 SYMM
        vm.startPrank(user);
        staking.deposit(100, user);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Notify reward of 1 wei per second
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
        amounts[0] = 1;
        address[] memory tokens = new address[](1);
        tokens[0] = rewardToken;
        staking.notifyRewardAmount(tokens, amounts);

        // Warp time by 1 second
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

        // Calculate expected reward per token
        uint256 expectedRewardPerToken = 1e18 / 100; // 1e16
        uint256 actualRewardPerToken = staking.rewardPerToken(rewardToken);

        // Check precision loss
        assertEq(actualRewardPerToken, expectedRewardPerToken, "Precision loss in reward calculation");
        console.log("Actual reward per token:", actualRewardPerToken);
        console.log("Expected reward per token:", expectedRewardPerToken);

        // User's earned rewards
        uint256 earned = staking.earned(user, rewardToken);
        console.log("User earned:", earned);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Increase Precision:
Modify the precision factor from 1e18 to 1e36 to reduce rounding errors. Update the rewardPerToken function accordingly:
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
    }
    return
        rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
        (((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e36) /
            totalSupply);
}
```
