# Users can prevent removal of reward tokens for stablecoins

### Summary

Tokens can only be removed from the whitelist after full distribution, but it's possible to prevent it.

### Root Cause

In `deposit()`, users can deposit SYMM tokens for any address other than zero in order to participate in staking and subsequently earning rewards. Since the caller can deposit it to any address, they can also deposit to addresses that are blacklisted, assuming the reward tokens are stablecoins. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets a centralized stablecoin as one of the reward tokens.
2. User deposits dusty amounts of SYMM on behalf of a blacklisted address.
3. In order to remove the coin from the token reward list, the reward manager attempts to call [`claimFor()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L302) for all remaining addresses.
4. The transfer operation fails for the blacklisted address, as the safeTransfer call reverts.

### Impact

`configureRewardToken()` will revert as there's technically pending rewards, and the protocol will permanently include the token as a reward token. If an user deposits a significant amount of SYMM tokens, this will cause permanent loss of the percentage of reward tokens allocated to the blacklisted address. For example, if the attacker deposited 1% of the total deposited amount, then 1% of the generated yield is unable to be retrieved. 

### Mitigation

Use a try-catch method in order to transfer the tokens.
```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				try IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward) {
				} catch {}
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
