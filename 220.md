# Reward Manager would never be able to remove any particular whitelisted reward token if any user unable to claim his reward token for being blacklisted against that reward token(Ex-USDC)

### Summary

While calling  `SymmStaking :configureRewardToken()` function Reward manager fails to remove reward token due to user's inability to claim reward tokens for being blacklisted in that reward tokens(USDC, USDT)

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320C4-L320C101

In `SymmStaking:configureRewardToken()` function  the condition
```solidity
 if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```
makes it impossible for Reward manager to remove any whitelisted reward token if someone get blacklisted from that reward token and unable to claim his reward.  Even Admin can not force claim for being that account is blacklisted. 
Admin does have the  ability to rescue this locked token
```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```
But the variable `pendingRewards[token]` is not being updated. This vulnerability totally prevent the admin or reward manager ever to remove any token which is once become whitelisted.
