# Adding Liquidity Functionalities Will Break if USDC Turns on Fee-On-Transfer

### Summary

In the case where USDC turns on Fee-On-Transfer, the actual amount sent to the BalancerV3 router, the liquidity adding process may revert and this will create a DOS situation.

### Root Cause

The function `_addLiquidity()` takes USDC tokens from the user (`usdcIn`) and sends them to the router:

```Solidity
		amountsIn = new uint256[](2);
		amountsIn[0] = symmIn;
		amountsIn[1] = usdcIn;

		uint256 initialLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));

		// Call the router to add liquidity.
		amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
			address(POOL),
			amountsIn,
			expectedLpAmount,
			false, // wethIsEth: bool
			"" // userData: bytes
		);
```

But if USDC (which is upgradeable) turns on its feature for fee-on-transfer, the amount which is transferred into the contract would be less than the amount is sent to the [BalancerV3 router](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L197), and this will cause to revert in some cases.

Furthermore, this issue can break the liquidity adding process, since there are lesser funds in the contract rather than the amount passed to the router, and can make a DOS situation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDC needs to turn on its FOT feature

### Attack Path

1. The `usdcIn` is 100 while the transferred amount is 95
2. This `usdcIn` is passed to the function `addLiquidityProportional()` of the router.
3. As the current USDC balance is 95, the process will revert silently
4. The user couldn't add liquidity

### Impact

DOS situation can be happened in some certain cases, preventing uses from adding liquidity to the SymmVesting contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider sending the **actual** received USDC tokens instead of input quoted `usdcIn`
