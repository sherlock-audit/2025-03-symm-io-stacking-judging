# Admin can steal all staked tokens and rewards through rescueTokens function

### Summary

The missing validation in rescueTokens function will cause a complete loss of funds for stakers as admin can drain all staked tokens and rewards through the rescue mechanism.

### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol:rescueTokens` (lines 343-346) 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343-346' there are no checks preventing the rescue of staking or reward tokens, allowing admin to drain user funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have staked tokens or reward tokens.
2. Admin role needs to be assigned to an address.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions required.


### Attack Path

1. Admin waits for users to stake tokens and/or rewards to accumulate.
2. Admin calls `rescueTokens(stakingToken, amount, adminAddress)` to drain staked tokens.
3. Admin calls `rescueTokens(rewardToken, amount, adminAddress)` to drain reward tokens.
4. Users lose their staked tokens and unclaimed rewards.

### Impact

The stakers suffer a complete loss of their staked tokens and unclaimed rewards. The admin gains:
  - All staked tokens in the contract
  - All unclaimed reward tokens
  - Ability to drain future deposits and rewards

          staking.deposit(1000, user);
          vm.stopPrank();
          
          // Admin drains staked tokens
          uint256 stakedBalance = IERC20(staking.stakingToken()).balanceOf(address(staking));
          staking.rescueTokens(staking.stakingToken(), stakedBalance, admin);
          
          // Verify drain
          assertEq(IERC20(staking.stakingToken()).balanceOf(address(staking)), 0);
          assertEq(IERC20(staking.stakingToken()).balanceOf(admin), stakedBalance);
      }
  }
  ```

### Mitigation

1. Add validation checks to prevent rescuing staking and reward tokens:
     ```solidity
     function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
         require(token != stakingToken, "Cannot rescue staking token");
         require(!isRewardToken[token], "Cannot rescue reward token");
         IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
         emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
     }
     ```
  2. Consider implementing a timelock for admin rescue operations
  3. Add maximum rescue amount limits
  4. Implement multi-signature requirement for rescue operations
