# Users who add liquidity to the `SymmVesting` contract can have their funds stuck in the contract

## Impact
### Summary 
The protocol allows users to use their locked tokens to add liquidity on the `SymmVesting` contract in exchange for some pool tokens. However, the protocol does not have option for users to remove liquidity from the protocol.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability lies in the fact users can add liquidity to the protocol by calling the `SymmVesting::addLiquidity` (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L99-L105)) but `SymmVesting.sol` does not have a  function that enables users to remove liquidity from the protocol.

### Impact

If users add liquidity to the protocol, they will not be able to get those tokens back as there is no function to enable liquidity removal from the protocol. In such case, user tokens are stuck in the protocol.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a function that will enable users remove liquidity from the `SymmVesting` contract. This way, user tokens can not get stuck in the contract.
