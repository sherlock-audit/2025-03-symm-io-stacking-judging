# User might not be able to add liquidity

### Summary

The `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityByPercentage` function depends on `_claimUnlockedToken` which may revert if the contract has insufficient liquidity.

### Root Cause

The method is not implemented in [`Vesting.sol:254`](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/main/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L254) which may revert the [`SymmVesting.sol:99`](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/token/blob/main/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L99)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to have some unclaimed tokens
2. The contract must have insufficient `SYMM` tokens

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

A user adds liquidity once. Claimed a portion of these tokens before expiration. Then before claiming all of this portion, he tried to add liquidity by `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityByPercentage` which calls `_addLiquidityProcess` and which first tries to claim SYMM tokens by calling `_claimUnlockedToken` which will revert if the contract has no sufficient liquidity and additional liquidity can't be added as well due to which the  `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityByPercentage` will fail, because it'll revert.

### Impact

Users may never be able to add liquidity into the contract if they have any unclaimed rewards.
