# _ensureSufficientBalance allows unlimited token minting

### Summary

In [`Vesting.sol:242`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L242), the `_ensureSufficientBalance` function in the protocol allows unrestricted minting of SYMM tokens. If amount is set to an excessively large value, the function will trigger the minting of a massive number of tokens, potentially leading to severe inflation and destabilizing the SYMM token economy.

### Root Cause

In the `_ensureSufficientBalance` function, when the contract’s balance is lower than the requested amount, it calculates the deficit and calls `_mintTokenIfPossible(token, deficit)`. However, there is no cap or restriction on amount, meaning a large request can trigger excessive minting of SYMM tokens.

```solidity
	function _ensureSufficientBalance(address token, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
		uint256 currentBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
		if (currentBalance < amount) {
@>			uint256 deficit = amount - currentBalance;
			// This hook can be overridden to mint the token.
			_mintTokenIfPossible(token, deficit);
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user or an internal function requests a very large amount of SYMM tokens.
2. The contract’s SYMM token balance is less than the requested amount.
3. `_mintTokenIfPossible` is implemented in a way that allows minting without a cap.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A function that calls `_ensureSufficientBalance` requests a massive amount of SYMM tokens.
2. Since the contract’s balance is insufficient, `_ensureSufficientBalance` calculates a deficit and calls `_mintTokenIfPossible`.
3. `_mintTokenIfPossible` mints the deficit amount without limitation.
4. The attacker or function now has access to an arbitrarily large number of SYMM tokens, causing hyperinflation.

### Impact

- Any function relying on `_ensureSufficientBalance` can cause unintended minting, making the protocol unreliable.
- Uncontrolled Inflation: The SYMM token supply can be artificially increased without limit, leading to hyperinflation.
- Market Devaluation: An attacker or user could mint excessive tokens, flooding the market and drastically reducing SYMM’s value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Set a Hard Cap: Implement a maximum minting limit to prevent excessive token creation.
- Require Governance Approval: Restrict `_mintTokenIfPossible` to only be callable through governance decisions.
- Ensure `_ensureSufficientBalance` does not allow minting beyond a reasonable limit.
