# disableInitializers not used to prevent uninitialized contracts

### Summary

All the contracts are designed to be upgradeable.

In order to prevent leaving an implementation contract uninitialized it is recommended adding the `_disableInitializers()` function in the constructor to lock the contracts automatically when they are deployed [see openzepplin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-_disableInitializers--)

### Root Cause

[`SymmStaking`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L153) , [`Vesting`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol) and [`SymmVesting`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol) are all upgradeable contracts but lack the important constructor call `_disableInitializers()` which locks the contract and prevent any future reinitialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contracts need to be deployed but `initialize()` has not been called yet.

### External Pre-conditions

/-/

### Attack Path

Attacker can call the `initialize()` function of the uninitialized contracts and add himself as admin. 

### Impact

Attacker can take over the deployed contracts and initialize them with his own values.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `_disableInitializers()` to the constructor. 

```Solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
