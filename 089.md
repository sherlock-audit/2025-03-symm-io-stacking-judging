# The rescueTokens method will unexpectedly extract funds belonging to the user.

## Summary

In the `rescueTokens()` function of the symmstaking.sol file, the administrator can transfer all the funds of the current contract, resulting in the user not being able to collect the reward funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `rescueTokens` function is designed to transfer tokens from the contract to a specified receiver. While it includes a reentrancy guard (`nonReentrant`) to prevent reentrancy attacks, it lacks proper validation to ensure that the tokens being transferred are not inadvertently withdrawing user rewards or unauthorized funds. Specifically:

- **Problem**: The function does not check if the tokens being transferred are part of the contract's own funds or if they belong to users as rewards. This can lead to the contract administrator withdrawing tokens that should be allocated to users.
- **Consequence**: Malicious actors with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` privileges could exploit this vulnerability to steal user rewards or other funds that should not be transferable by the administrator.


## Impact

- **Medium**: This vulnerability could result in the unauthorized withdrawal of user funds, leading to a loss of trust in the platform and potential financial losses for users. 

## Code Snippet

[2025-03-symm-io-stacking/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol at d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3 · sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking · GitHub](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343)

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Withdraw specific amount of token.
 * @param token The token address.
 * @param receiver The address of receiver
 * @param amount The amount.
 */
//@audit-issue Unexpectedly transferring rewards to users
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```

## Vulnerable Code

The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation to ensure that the tokens being transferred are not user rewards or other restricted funds. Specifically:

- **Line 12**: `IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);`
  - **Issue**: This line transfers the specified amount of tokens without checking if the tokens belong to the contract or if they are part of user rewards.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

1. **Setup**:
   
   - Deploy the contract with some initial funds.
   - Assign `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to an administrator address.
   - Users deposit tokens into the contract as part of a reward system.

2. **Exploit**:
   
   - The administrator calls `rescueTokens` with the token address of the reward token, a large amount, and an external receiver address.
   - The contract transfers the specified amount of tokens to the receiver, potentially draining user rewards.

3. **Result**:
   
   - The user's tokens and reward tokens are lost.

## Conclusion

The rescueTokens function currently lacks the necessary checks to prevent the unauthorized withdrawal of user rewards. To remediate this vulnerability:

1. **Add Validation**:
Ensure that the tokens being transferred are not part of user rewards or other restricted funds.

2. **Modify Function**:
Update the function to include validations and possibly introduce a whitelist of allowed tokens for withdrawal.
