# Anyone can call the notifyRewardAmount function to manuplate the rate

### Summary

The notifyRewardAmount function in SymmStaking.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275 
This function is responsible for adding new tokens, with the reward rate being determined by the amount of tokens added. However, since there are no access controls in place, anyone can call this function, add arbitrary tokens, and manipulate the rate calculation.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374 
This allows an attacker to influence the reward distribution mechanism, impacting the rewards users receive.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200 
An attacker can front-run a transaction when a user with a significant unclaimed reward calls claimRewards, taking advantage of the manipulated rate.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374 
By calling notifyRewardAmount with a very small reward token amount, the attacker can artificially lower the reward rate. As a result, users expecting large unclaimed rewards will receive significantly less than intended due to this manipulation.

### Root Cause

The notifyRewardAmount function lacks proper access control, allowing anyone to call it.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275 
Each time a new reward token is added, the duration resets, and the reward rate is recalculated based on the remaining and newly added tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374
Due to the absence of restrictions, an attacker can exploit this function to manipulate the reward rate and impact the overall reward distribution.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one reward token should be whitelisted and added.
2. The reward distribution process should remain active and ongoing.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A sufficient amount of time should have elapsed during the rewards distribution period.

### Attack Path

1. A user with a large unclaimed reward balance calls the claimRewards function.
2. An attacker front-runs the transaction by invoking notifyRewardAmount with a small reward amount, causing the reward rate to decrease.
3. When the user's claimRewards transaction executes, it uses the manipulated lower rate, resulting in the user receiving fewer reward tokens than expected.

### Impact

The user receives fewer rewards than expected.
