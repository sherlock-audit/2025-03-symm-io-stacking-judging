# RewardToken not set anywhere in Symmskaking.sol contract

### Summary

The configureRewardToken function calls _updateRewardsStates before adding or removing a token from the rewardTokens array. This means that when _updateRewardsStates is called, the rewardTokens.length will return zero if no tokens have been added yet. This leads to incorrect state updates and potential vulnerabilities in the reward system.

### Root Cause


in staking contract there is no place where the rewardsToken is set except inside of ```configureRewardsTokens``` and the  ```configureRewardsTokens``` makes a call to an internal function ```_updateRewardsStates``` which tries to get the length of rewardsToken. At this point when the admin tries to do this configuration RewarsToken.length is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

When admin tries to configureRewardTokens by adding whitelisted tokens or setting previous whitelisted tokens to zero

### External Pre-conditions

RewardsToken not set by admin

### Attack Path


rewardTokens.length = 0 (no tokens have been added yet).

Call configureRewardToken:

The function calls _updateRewardsStates(address(0)).

Since rewardTokens.length = 0, the loop in _updateRewardsStates does not execute.

No reward states are updated.




### Impact

Causes a fail in the the for loop of ```_updateRewardsStates``` causing an ArrayOutOfBound Error which shouldn't allow the RewardsTokens to be set.



```solidity
function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		@> uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
			state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored; //@audit per token stored equals zero.
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
