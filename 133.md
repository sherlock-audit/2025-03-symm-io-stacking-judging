# Vesting contract will not work with some tokens that it's expected to work with

### Summary

The vesting contract is unable to work with USDT due to not using the `SafeERC20` library functions, even though it's imported and declared as `using SafeERC20 for IERC20`.

### Root Cause

The `Vesting.sol` contract imports the `SafeERC20` OZ library and even [declares using it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L14), but when the actual transfer functions are called in order for users to claim their unlocked amounts, the `safeTransfer()` function is [not used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272):

```solidity
	function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();

		// Adjust the vesting plan
		totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
		vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;

		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);

@>		IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);

		emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
	}
```

Since the protocol [expects to work](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate) with USDC, USDT, USDE & Symmio tokens, this is problematic. USDT does not return a bool value (even on Base), so the regular `transfer()` call will revert and users will be unable to claim their vested tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users are unable to claim vested USDT tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the library's functions, otherwise why would it be imported and declared as `using` in the first place at all?
