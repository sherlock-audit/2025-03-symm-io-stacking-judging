# Lack of SafeERC20 usage in vesting claim transfers

### Summary

The vesting contract uses direct calls to `IERC20(token).transfer(...)` without employing a SafeERC20 wrapper. This approach does not check the return value, which can lead to silent failures with non-standard ERC-20 tokens, causing discrepancies in vesting accounting.

### Root Cause

In [SymmVesting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol) and [Vesting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol), the functions `_claimUnlockedToken` and `_claimLockedToken` call `IERC20(token).transfer(...)` directly but never checks the return value. If a token does not strictly follow the ERC-20 standard (for example, returning `false` on failure instead of reverting, as some older or non-compliant tokens do), the contract would not know the transfer failed. This means the contract’s state (reducing the vesting amount and `totalVested`) would update as if the user received tokens, but the user may actually receive nothing. The issue is exacerbated for tokens like USDT which historically return false on failure, or any token with custom transfer logic. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract interacts with ERC-20 tokens that do not strictly revert on failure but return false.
2. Token transfer functions are expected to succeed, and the internal accounting relies on them.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker (or inadvertent misconfiguration) deploys a non-standard token as a reward or vesting token.
2. When a claim is executed, the token’s transfer returns false (or fails silently), but the contract proceeds to update its internal state as if the transfer succeeded.
3. The victim’s vesting balance is reduced while they receive no tokens, effectively “burning” their vested funds.

### Impact

The user loses the full value of their vesting claim; the attacker does not directly gain but disrupts user funds.

### PoC

```solidity
// Non-standard token that returns false on transfer
bool success = IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimAmount);
require(success, "Transfer failed"); // This check is missing
// Without this check, internal state is updated even if transfer fails.

```

### Mitigation

Replace `IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount)` with `IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, amount)`. This ensures that if a token transfer fails or returns false, the transaction reverts.
