# Reward Manager will break reward distribution for users as fee-on-transfer tokens reduce actual rewards

## Summary:
A bug in the `notifyRewardAmount` function causes reward accounting errors for fee-on-transfer tokens. The function increases `pendingRewards[token]` by the nominal amount, ignoring the fact that the actual received amount may be lower due to transfer fees.

## Root Cause:
In `SymmStaking.sol:notifyRewardAmount`, the contract calls:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L287C4-L288C36
```solidity
			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
```
If the token charges a fee, the actual amount received is less than amount.

## Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The reward token implements fee-on-transfer logic (e.g., charges a 1% fee).

## Attack Path:
1. The Reward Manager calls `notifyRewardAmount(token, 1000)` on a fee-on-transfer token.
2. Due to a 1% fee, only 990 tokens are received, but `pendingRewards[token]` is incremented by 1000.
3. When users claim rewards, there is a shortfall, causing claims to fail.

## Impact:
Users cannot claim full rewards, leading to reward distribution failure and loss of user trust.

When users call 'claimRewards', the contract attempts to transfer rewards based on pendingRewards[token] (e.g., 1000). However, the actual balance is only 990 due to the fee, causing the transfer in _claimRewardsFor to fail (via safeTransfer) when pendingRewards[token] exceeds the contractâ€™s balance. This is evident in:

```solidity

IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward); // Fails if reward > actual balance

```

## PoC
This PoC simulates the `notifyRewardAmount` function with a fee-on-transfer token where the actual amount received is less than the specified amount, leading to a discrepancy in `pendingRewards`.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { SymmStaking } from "../typechain-types";

describe("SymmStaking - Fee-on-Transfer Reward Accounting", function () {
  let staking: SymmStaking;
  let rewardManager: any;
  const rewardTokenAddress = "0xFeeOnTransferToken"; // Replace with a fee-on-transfer token address

  before(async function () {
    [rewardManager] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const StakingFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmStaking", rewardManager);
    staking = (await StakingFactory.deploy()) as SymmStaking;
    await staking.deployed();
  });

  it("should overstate pending rewards when fee-on-transfer is applied", async function () {
    const notifyAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18);
    // Record balance before calling notifyRewardAmount.
    const balanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(rewardTokenAddress); // For a real ERC20, use the token contract
    // Reward Manager calls notifyRewardAmount.
    await staking.connect(rewardManager).notifyRewardAmount([rewardTokenAddress], [notifyAmount]);
    // For demonstration, pendingRewards is increased by notifyAmount, even if actual received amount is lower.
    const pending = await staking.pendingRewards(rewardTokenAddress);
    expect(pending).to.equal(notifyAmount); // Bug: expected should be lower (e.g., 990 tokens) if fee applies.
  });
});
```
**PoC Explanation:**

- The Bug:
The contract adds the nominal amount to `pendingRewards` without checking the actual token balance change.

- How It Works:
When a fee-on-transfer token is used, the actual tokens received are lower than the amount transferred. However, the contract still records the full amount, causing a discrepancy.

- Attack Scenario:
An attacker (or misconfigured reward manager) can cause reward claims to fail since users will not receive the expected full amount of rewards.

## Mitigation:
Measure the balance change before and after the transfer:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 received = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
pendingRewards[token] += received;
```
