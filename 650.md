# Double spending attack in the Vesting contract

### Summary

The function resetVestingPlans() is called by an administrator account and resets vesting plans for a list of users, with the corresponding amount provided as input. The function calls _resetVestingPlans(), where it checks whether the given amount is greater than or equal to the claimed amount for the user. After that, it calls resetAmount() from LibVestingPlan. In this function, the state is updated, the new amount is recorded, and claimedAmount is set to 0.



### Root Cause

The issue here is that this can lead to double spending. Even though the user executing the request is trusted, they cannot know whether another transaction has been executed before theirs, in which the user whose vesting plan is being reset has withdrawn their locked amount by paying a penalty fee. If this happens, the user will be able to claim the same amount again after the reset, which would harm other users who might not be able to claim their rewards.
