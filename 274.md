# `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` can be called with 1 wei amount to DoS rewards

### Summary

[SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) calculates the rate as `amount / state.duration`. Every time it is called, some dust builds up. As it can be called any amount of times and with any amount, users can specify 1 wei and trigger the rounding error intentionally, decreasing rewards until 0 for all users.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking:275`, anyone can call `notifyRewardAmount()` any number of times at any time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` as many times as they please until the rate goes to 0.

### Impact

### PoC
