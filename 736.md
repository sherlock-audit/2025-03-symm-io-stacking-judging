# Wrong default slippage check in SymmVesting

### Summary

In the _addLiquidity() function of the SymmVesting contract, there is a default slippage check for cases where a min amount is not provided. However, this check is ineffective because it is calculated based on on-chain data from the Balancer contract, which may have already been affected by balance changes that could lead to slippage.



### Root Cause

Such a check does not make sense because no change in the ratios can occur during the transaction execution that would result in the user receiving fewer tokens than expected. Potential changes can only happen before the transaction itself. Therefore, the slippage check value should be based on data obtained beforehand.
