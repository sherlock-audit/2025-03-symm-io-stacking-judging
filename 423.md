# Attacker will DOS removing whitelist for token by keeping its pendingRewards > 10

### Summary

Unrestricted access to `SymmStaking.sol:notifyRewardAmount()` will cause a DoS impact for the reward manager as an attacker will repeatedly increase pendingRewards to block token blacklisting.

### Root Cause

The lack of access control on `SymmStaking.sol:notifyRewardAmount()` allows anyone to call it and increase `pendingRewards[token]`, which prevents blacklisting if `pendingRewards[token] > 10` in `SymmStaking.sol:configureRewardToken()`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward manager needs to call `configureRewardToken()` to set `isRewardToken[token]` to true.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with some value to increase `pendingRewards[token]` above 10.
2. Reward manager will call `configureRewardToken(token, false)` but it will revert.

### Impact

The reward manager cannot blacklist unwanted tokens.
