# resetAmount


## Core Issue in `resetAmount`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71

```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();

    uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();

    // 1. Reset start time to the current block timestamp
    self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    // 2. Calculate new end time based on remaining duration
    self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    // 3. Set the new total amount
    self.amount = amount;
    // 4. Reset claimed amount to zero
    self.claimedAmount = 0;

    return self;
}
```

After invoking `resetAmount`, the previous state of "vested + claimed" tokens is essentially reset:

1. **`claimedAmount` is reset to zero:**  
   This erases the historical record of tokens already claimed.

2. **The start time is reset to the current block timestamp:**  
   As long as there is some remaining duration (`remaining > 0`), the plan's end time becomes `block.timestamp + remaining`.  
   - For instance, if there were 50 seconds left, the new vesting window becomes "current time â†’ current time + 50 seconds," combined with a potentially increased `amount`.

3. **Tokens that have been unlocked but not claimed yet must be claimed first (since `claimable == 0` is required).**  
   Although this seems to prevent repeated resetting without claiming, it doesn't prevent the beneficiary from increasing the total amount and resetting the `claimedAmount`, allowing them to unlock tokens again.

## Example Attack Path

Assuming no additional access controls (i.e., anyone, including the beneficiary, can call `resetAmount`), an exploit scenario unfolds as follows:

### 1. **Initial Setup**  
- An admin (or the beneficiary) calls the initial setup:
  - `amount = 100`
  - `startTime = 0`
  - `endTime = 100` (simple linear vesting over 100 seconds)

### 2. **Claim Midway**  
- At time `t = 50`, half the tokens (50 tokens) are vested.
- Beneficiary claims these 50 tokens.  
- Now: `claimedAmount = 50`, and `claimable(self) = 0`.

### 3. **Invoke `resetAmount` to Increase Total**  
- Since `claimable(self) == 0`, the precondition for calling `resetAmount` is satisfied.
- The beneficiary calls `resetAmount(self, 1000)`, drastically increasing the total amount.
- Internally, the contract calculates: 
  ```
  remaining = endTime - block.timestamp = 100 - 50 = 50
  ```
- Then, it sets:
  - `startTime` to `t = 50`
  - `endTime` to `50 + 50 = 100`
  - `amount` to `1000`
  - `claimedAmount` resets to `0`

### 4. **Repeated Vesting to Obtain Extra Tokens**  
- The new vesting window is again from `t = 50` to `t = 100`, but now the total vesting amount is 1000 tokens.
- Since `claimedAmount` has been reset, over the next 50 seconds, the beneficiary can linearly claim the full 1000 tokens again.
- As a result, the beneficiary receives a total of 50 (originally claimed) + 1000 (from the reset period) = **1050 tokens**, significantly exceeding the original intended limit of 100 tokens.

### Key Takeaways

- The crux of the exploit is that **`resetAmount` fails to preserve historical claims**. As long as some vesting time remains, it allows increasing the total vested amount and resetting claimed tokens, enabling repeated claims.
- The contract must implement external controls, like restricting `resetAmount` calls strictly to administrators who handle additional logical checks and state validation.  
- Without these precautions, the contract is vulnerable to repeated exploitation of the claim-reset-increase cycle.

## Mitigation Recommendations

- **Implement Access Control**:  
  Limit `resetAmount` calls exclusively to trusted admin roles, disallowing arbitrary or beneficiary-triggered resets without rigorous checks.

- **Preserve Historical Claims**:  
  When adjusting the total vested amount, retain previously claimed amounts and ensure the new plan accounts for these prior claims to avoid double vesting.

- **Prohibit Midstream Modifications**:  
  Generally, midstream vesting plan changes are risky. If modifications are necessary, either require fully concluding the existing vesting period or carefully implement a method that ensures consistent accounting.

## Conclusion

The critical vulnerability in `resetAmount` arises from its "rebasing" approach that resets the vesting curve and erases historical claim records. Without proper access control or additional logical safeguards, attackers or even beneficiaries can exploit this repeatedly to gain more tokens than
