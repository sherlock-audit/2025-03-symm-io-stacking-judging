# Dust attack can dilute reward distribution

### Summary

Malicious users can grief the protocol by notifying dust amounts of reward tokens to manipulate rewardPerSecond, artificially extending reward vesting periods for all users.

### Root Cause

Anyone can call `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` to add rewards to the protocol.

```solidity

	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
@>			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

When handling adding rewards, current rewardState is reset. To match a new duration, which is the constant `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION`, the duration to go is reset to its initial value from now halfway, and reward rate goes down with the extended duration.

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@>		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` to transfer in dust amounts as rewards.
2. The reward distribution duration is extended by constant length per attack.

### Impact

Enables permanent griefing attacks that lock legitimate rewards for longer periods. This would be unfair for users who deposited to get rewards based on current rate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply access control to  `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` .
