# Whitested tokens cannot be removed

### Summary

Whitested tokens cannot be removed, loop might become too big in the future and potentially cause DOS

### Root Cause

When attempting to remove a token from the whitelist via `configureRewardToken()`, the function checks if `pendingRewards[token] > 10`, reverting if true. This creates a situation where tokens can be permanently locked in the whitelist.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320
```solidity
if (!status) {
    if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
}
```

This can occur because of things:
1. Users being blacklisted for the token and thus not being able to claim
2. `_addRewardsForToken` rounding down and thus `rate * duration` never being equal to `pendingRewards[token]`


### Internal Pre-conditions

A few tokens to be added

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

There are 10 reward tokens, admins want to remove some since they are no longer used

1. If 1000 users haven't claimed for that token then they need to call `claimFor` for each individual user
2. If one of them is balcklisted the token will never be removed
3. In general the token will never be removed as `_addRewardsForToken` rounds down our rate

Even if 3 is fixed, the above 2 will still be an issue.


### Impact

Admins cannot remove reward tokens if the pendingRewards balance exceeds 10 wei, which can happen permanently due to rounding errors in `_addRewardsForToken()`, or if certain users never claim their rewards. 


Note that in the case of them being too many whitelisted tokens the for loop can DOS the contract.

Also because we loop over tokens that would be no longer distributed then the whole system wasted more gas than necessary. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the threshold, admins are trusteed and are able to resque tokens, thus no such checks are needed
