# Vesting plan can be manipulated into an uninitialized state

### Summary

Users can transform an already set up vesting plan into an uninitialized state due to the `VestingPlanOps::isSetup` function only checking whether the vesting planâ€™s `amount` is nonzero. A user can manipulate this by calling `Vesting::claimLockedToken` or `SymmVesting::addLiquidity` to reset the amount to zero.  

[VestingPlanOps::isSetup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L87) function:
```javascript
function isSetup(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (bool) {
    return self.amount != 0;
}
```

Since `isSetup` only checks whether `amount != 0`, a user can set `amount` to zero by calling `Vesting::claimLockedToken` or `SymmVesting::addLiquidity` with `amount` equal to the total locked amount. This occurs because these functions internally call `VestingPlanOps::resetAmount` function.

### Root Cause

The `VestingPlanOps::isSetup` function only checks whether the vesting plan's `amount` is nonzero, which is insufficient because `amount` can be reset to zero while the vesting plan is still logically active.

### Impact

- Permissioned users cannot reset vesting plans for users whose vesting plans have been reset to `amount = 0`, because `Vesting::resetVestingPlans` calls `VestingPlanOps::resetAmount`, which reverts when `VestingPlanOps::isSetup` returns `false`.  
- This can disrupt vesting plan modifications and administrative actions.

### Mitigation

Modify the `VestingPlanOps::isSetup` function to check `startTime` instead of `amount`:

```diff
function isSetup(VestingPlan storage self) public view returns (bool) {
-   return self.amount != 0;
+   return self.startTime != 0;
}
```
