# `resetAmount` Function: Unauthorized Vesting Plan Manipulation

### Summary

The lack of proper access controls and input validation in the resetAmount function will cause a critical impact for vesting plan holders as an attacker  will be able to arbitrarily modify vesting plans. This vulnerability allows an unauthorized actor to rebase vesting schedules, set new token totals, and reset claimed amounts, leading to extended vesting durations or potential denial of vesting claims.

### Root Cause

In [LibVestingPlan.sol] (or the corresponding source file), the resetAmount function does not enforce any authorization checks nor does it validate that the caller is permitted to modify the vesting plan. The function simply:

Rebases the vesting plan from the current time,
Sets the new total token amount,
Resets claimedAmount to zero.
This design flaw permits any actor with access to call this function (or via a misused admin function) to override the vesting parameters, regardless of the original agreement with the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Vesting Plan Existence:

A vesting plan must be set up with nonzero amount and defined startTime and endTime.

Claimable State:

The plan must have zero claimable tokens (i.e. claimable(self) == 0) for the reset to proceed.

Plan Duration:

The remaining duration must be nonzero, otherwise the function reverts.

### External Pre-conditions

An actor with access to call functions that internally invoke resetAmount (e.g., via an administrative or misconfigured contract call) must be able to trigger the reset.

### Attack Path

Triggering the Reset:

An attacker (or a malicious admin) calls the function that internally invokes resetAmount on a target userâ€™s vesting plan.

Rebasing the Vesting Plan:

The function resets startTime to block.timestamp and endTime to block.timestamp + remainingDuration(self), effectively rebasing the vesting 
schedule.

Overriding Total and Claimed Values:

The total vesting amount is arbitrarily set to a new amount, and claimedAmount is reset to zero.

### Impact

Too much power in the hand of monkey , this can lead to multiple impacts

1.  Grief attack : set `self.startTime = block.timestamp;` in future.

2. loss of funds :  

-> set `self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;` in far future resulting in funds locked inside contract. 
-> or even set  `self.claimedAmount = 0;` to a really large value stopping from claims.
 
and much more is possible.




		
		
		

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Mark `resetAmount` as internal which will make it only available for the contracts inheriting it.
