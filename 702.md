# rewards rate of rewards tokens , can be manipulated and reduced , due to logic in _addRewardsForToken

### Summary

In SymmVesting.sol, there is no accessControl, on who can add rewards by calling notifyRewardsAmount.

So anyone can call addrewardtoken which is whitelisted , with the help of this function. And issue here is rewards is re-calculated with the amount of new rewards are added and there is no check for minAmount should be added. So anyone can manipulated this by adding small amount of rewards and changing the rewards rate, and unncessary delaying rewards for claiming

### Root Cause

### Internal Pre-conditions

whitelisted tokens should be already added by someone ( geniune)

### External Pre-conditions

manipulator should have some wei or some amount of rewards tokens and can add this by notify reward amount

### Attack Path

lets take a simple example , that rewards are already added and ( duariton is 1 week ).

in the mid week ( or any time in between )  manipulator add this rewards with very small amount , now left over amount will be added with this very small amount and then duration would be again now for 1 week from that timestamp

means just for small amount , rate would be decreased so much that another few more days , this tokens will not be claimed , which it should be originally. So this can be temporary freezing of funds too , as rewards rate is lowered drastically 

     if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

### Impact

user , rewards rate will be lowered drastically by attacker and user will able to claim that rewards in a delayed form, means this can be temporay freezing of funds too. and manipulation of rewards rate 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

new state.rate should be higher , this can be one solution.

or alteast some min amount check should be there , while adding rewards, so it cannot be lowered drastically
