# Incorrect Initializer Modifier in Vesting Contract Will Prevent Child Contract Initialization

### Summary

The use of the `initializer` modifier in the base initialization function `__vesting_init` will cause a complete failure of initialization for derived contracts such as **SymmVesting**. This happens because the `initializer` modifier prevents a function from being called more than once. When a derived contract calls its own `initialize` function—which in turn calls `__vesting_init`—the base function is treated as already initialized, causing a revert. In effect, this misconfiguration blocks the upgradeable contract from being properly deployed.

### Root Cause

In the Vesting contract, the __vesting_init function uses the initializer modifier:

```solidity
function __vesting_init(...) public initializer { ... }
```
When inherited by SymmVesting, its initialize function (which also uses initializer) calls __vesting_init. Since initializer enforces a one-time initialization guard, the parent function’s modifier conflicts with the child’s, causing a revert.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The derived contract (e.g., SymmVesting) must call its own initialize function.

### External Pre-conditions

*

### Attack Path

1. Deploy the SymmVesting contract.

2. Call SymmVesting.initialize(...).

3. The function attempts to invoke Vesting.__vesting_init.

4. The initializer modifier in __vesting_init checks if the contract is already initialized.

5. Since SymmVesting’s initialize is marked with initializer, the parent’s modifier detects reinitialization and reverts.

### Impact

The SymmVesting contract cannot be initialized.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace initializer with onlyInitializing in Vesting.__vesting_init:

```solidity
function __vesting_init(...) public onlyInitializing { ... }
```
