# Accurate Calculation of User-Inaccessible Rewards When `totalSupply == 0` via `deposit()`

### Summary

When `totalSupply == 0`, reward tokens inside the contract may contain both unclaimed rewards (if an empty `totalSupply` were to happen in the future where all stakers would withdraw all staked `SYMM` tokens) and user-inaccessible rewards that were added when no one was staking. Since the fix in my other report ensures `pendingRewards[token]` is only updated when `totalSupply != 0`, we can now reliably determine and recover inaccessible rewards automatically when staking resumes via `deposit()`.

Determining the user-inaccessible rewards required off-chain estimations, as the contract did not distinguish between rewards intended for stakers and excess rewards added while staking was inactive. With the fix in this report, it eliminates the need for admin intervention via `rescueTokens()` which will more be appropriately applicable to retrieving accidentally sent in tokens after all. And, at the same time, it makes sure the first and the initial depositors receive their rightful share of rewards for existing rewards already sent into the contract rather than missing out on a time gap till the next reward distribution. 

So in short, the fix in this report will prevent under-distributing rewards, and also avoid an inaccurate estimation of inaccessible rewards.

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking.sol, when `totalSupply == 0`:

1. Reward tokens continue to be transferred into the contract via `notifyRewardAmount()`.
2. Due to the suggested fix in my other report, `pendingRewards[token]` does not increase, preventing governance lock when making a [reward token whitelist update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320), but leaving excess rewards in the contract balance still.
3. Since the contract does not differentiate between distributable and non-distributable rewards, the admin must estimate the inaccessible rewards off-chain, leading to imprecise calculations and potential misallocation.
4. If these inaccessible rewards are not properly adjusted, either the new stakers after inactivity may not receive their full scheduled rewards, or a portion of excess rewards may still remain in the contract.

This issue arises because the contract balance includes both legitimate and inaccessible rewards, but there is no on-chain tracking mechanism to distinguish between them, requiring an unreliable off-chain estimation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `totalSupply` must be exactly 0 (no users are staking). It could either be right after contract deployment or later into the future when `totalSupply` is emptied again due to everyone making full withdrawals.
2. The distribution contract must have continued adding rewards, leading to accumulated tokens in the contract.
3. `pendingRewards[token]` was not updated because the fix in my other report prevents it from increasing when `totalSupply == 0`.
4. A user deposits tokens again, triggering the first stake after inactivity.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The staking contract must be deployed, and/or all users must have fully withdrawn their stake at some point.
2. Rewards continued being sent to the contract, even though no one was staking.

### Attack Path

1. Let's assume the staking contract has no active stakers ([`totalSupply == 0`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L240)) after all users have made a full [withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L257) of their `SYMM` tokens.
2. The distribution contract calls [`notifyRewardAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292), causing rewards to be added to the staking contract, but `pendingRewards[token]` remains unchanged (due to the fix from my other report).
3. The staking contract now holds excess reward tokens, which are not properly tracked on-chain.
4. When a new user deposits tokens, staking resumes.
5. Since there is no on-chain method to properly offset these excess rewards, the first depositor may receive an inaccurate allocation:
- If rewards are not properly accounted for, e.g. over estimation of the user inaccessible excess rewards and withdrawn via [`rescueTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L337-L346), the initial stakers may miss out on rewards that should have accrued.
- Alternatively, if the admin incorrectly makes an underestimates of user-inaccessible rewards off-chain, idling funds remain in the contract instead of being redistributed into the staking contract, leading to unfair reward allocation too.

**Here's One of the Myriad Ways Why Emitted Data is Insufficient for an Accurate Estimate**

`RewardNotified()` events include a default timestamp when rewards are added, but they do not indicate how those rewards should have been allocated over time. Example: If 50 reward tokens were added sporadically at T3, the event logs when it happened, but not whether those tokens were meant for past stakers or should be treated as excess rewards.

The contract only stores the latest `pendingRewards[token]` valueâ€”it does not store previous values. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L287-L291

```solidity
			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
```
Even if you extract event timestamps, tokens, and amounts, you cannot reconstruct past values of `pendingRewards[token]` at specific moments. When `totalSupply == 0`, `pendingRewards[token]` is not supposed to be incremented as already reported separately, but the `RewardNotified` event still emits.

Rewards accumulate dynamically over time (per block), but events only emit discrete points in time. If staking stopped at T2, rewards might have continued accruing for a short time, but event logs do not capture whether part of those rewards should have been distributed before T3.

If users gradually unstaked instead of all withdrawing at once, some of the accumulated rewards may still belong to past stakers. Event timestamps do not track which users were entitled to what portion of rewards at any given time.

Given the contract supports multiple reward tokens, each token has different timestamps, different rates, and different pending reward calculations. Even if you extract event timestamps, reconstructing an accurate per-token distribution history is infeasible.

### Impact

1. Eliminates the need for inaccurate manual estimations by the admin when recovering inaccessible rewards.
2. The first and initial depositors no longer miss out on their rightful rewards and receive them according to the scheduled distribution.
3. Users do not need to rely on the admin to recover inaccessible rewards manually that could run into under redistribution due to the missed out idling funds still stuck in the contract.
4. The contract remains self-sufficient, ensuring fair and transparent reward distribution.

### Mitigation

Consider making the following fix:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234-L243

```diff
+        address public distributionAddress; // Set this during initialization

	function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(receiver);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (receiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

+                // Handle inaccessible rewards if this is the first deposit after `totalSupply == 0`
+                if (totalSupply == 0) {
+                    uint256 contractBalance;

+                    // Adjust all reward tokens
+                    for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
+                        address token = rewardTokens[i];
+                        contractBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

+                        if (contractBalance > pendingRewards[token]) {
+                            uint256 inaccessibleRewards = contractBalance - pendingRewards[token];

+                            // Transfer inaccessible rewards to distribution address
+                            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(distributionAddress, inaccessibleRewards);
+                            emit RescueToken(token, inaccessibleRewards, distributionAddress);
+                        }
+                    }
+                }

		totalSupply += amount;
		balanceOf[receiver] += amount;
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, receiver);
	}
```

Note: The above fix is feasible contingent on the following fix I have suggested in another report:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292

```diff
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
-			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
+                        if (totalSupply != 0) {
+                            // Normal behavior: Add rewards to pendingRewards
+                            pendingRewards[token] += amount;
+                        }
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
