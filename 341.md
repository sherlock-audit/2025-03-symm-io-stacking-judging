# Unfair penalization due to transaction delays in `Vesting::_claimLockedToken`

### Summary


The possibility of locked tokens claims during transaction delays result in users incurring unnecessary penalty when claiming locked tokens via [claimLockedToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281).


### Root Cause

 The vesting contract allows users to claim locked tokens by paying a penalty. However, a critical flaw arises when the transactions are delayed due to network congestion. Here's a scenario,
 - User urgently needs y tokens (not a big amount) that are locked, but will be unlocked soon.
 - User initiates a transaction to claim y tokens (locked) by paying a penalty.
 - Due to network congestion, the transaction is delayed.
 - During the delay, y tokens naturally unlock.
 - When the transaction is finally processed, the contract penalizes the user for claiming y tokens that they could
   have gotten after the delay anyway.

 Base has experienced network congestions in the past. For example, When bitcoin surged to all-time high, there
 was a high trading activity resulting in a surge in network traffic. It could be due to this or that there are naturally
 more trasactions resulting in `claimLockedToken` getting executed after a delay.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls `claimLockedToken` on an `amount` that would get unlocked after a reasonable delay of minutes or an hour.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Network congestion due to high traffic.

### Attack Path

Here's an example,

For example, lockedAmount = 1000 and user needs 10 tokens urgently (note that these don't reflect actual amounts). Here's how it would play out,

 - User calls `claimLockedToken` requiring 10 tokens.
 - Transaction sits in mempool, but gets delayed. 
 - The 10 tokens unlock during this period (just an example. By no means does this reflect the actual amounts
   that get unlocked). So now, the locked amount is actually `1000 - 10 = 990`.
 - The transaction finally processes, and user is penalized on the `10`. The locked amount now is `990 - 10 = 980`.

### Impact

Users would pay penalties for tokens they could claim freely after the delayed transaction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a deadline parameter in `claimLockedToken`,

```diff

-	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
+	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount, uint256 deadline) internal {
+       if (block.timestamp > deadline) revert();
        ...
        ...

    }
```
