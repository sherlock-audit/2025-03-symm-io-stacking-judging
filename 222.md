# Users can not convert SYMM to LP

### Summary

It will be impossible to convert SYMM to LP tokens in some circumstances.

### Root Cause

The following condition is left in the code from a previous version. [Vesting.sol:231](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231)

```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
```

This was used in a previous version where the start time would remain unchanged when _resetVestingPlans() was called.

In the current version where `vestingPlan.resetAmount` is used we end up blocking the `addLiquidity()` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

For the `addLiquidity()` function to be blocked a user must first convert SYMM-> LP and then wait until the unlocked LP is larger than the amount of LP that can be received from the remaining unlocked SYMM.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path


Example:

`t_1` is when the start of the vesting period
`t_2` is at `duration/2`
`t_3` any time after `t_2`

At `t_1`: A user calls `addLiquidity()` to convert 50% of SYMM to LP

At `t_2`: 25% of the initial SYMM is still unlocked. 50% off the LP from `t_1` is unlocked.

At `t_3`: User is blocked from calling `addLquidity()` because the LP from the remaining SYMM amount will always be < than the already unlocked LP.

`addLiquidity()` will always revert on the following condition

```soliity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();

```


### Impact

Users will be blocked from converting SYMM to LP. 

### PoC

Remove condition since it is not needed anymore.
