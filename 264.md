# Dust Reward Lock in SymmStaking Token Removal



## **Summary**
The SymmStaking contract add a threshold for removing reward tokens allowing even negligible residual rewards as dust to permanently block the token removal. This leads to contract bloat and increased gas costs




## Impact
Reward tokens with residual balances (10 wei) cannot be removed, increasing storage and gas costs as every deposit/withdrawal incur unnecessary gas to loop over USDC in _updateRewardsStates.

## Vulnerability Details

The configureRewardToken function block the token removal if pendingRewards[token] > 10 (as 10 wei). This fixed threshold ignore the token decimals making even trivial amounts like 0.00000001 USDC sufficient to block removal.

The check pendingRewards[token] > 10 use a hardcoded 10-wei threshold so for tokens with high decimals like USDC: 6 decimals, 10 wei = 0.00001 USD which is operationally irrelevant but will permanently blocks removal.

The pendingRewards[token] track unclaimed rewards as the residual amounts can persist.
  
for example:

Admin attempt to remove a token that has a pendingRewards = 10 wei (0.00001 USDC) through the  configureRewardToken but the transaction revert due to pendingRewards > 10.

## POC 

1. A staking token SYMM and whitelist a reward token USDC with 6 decimals.

2. then call the notifyRewardAmount to add 11 wei (0.000011 USDC) as rewards.  
  ```solidity
  pendingRewards[USDC] += 11; // it is now 11 wei
  ```

3. allow the reward duration (DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION = 1 week) to pass but after expiration,  the periodFinish for USDC is now in the past so no staker claim the 11 wei

4. then the admin call the configureRewardToken(USDC, false) to remove USDC.  
  ```solidity
  if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(
.....); 
  ```
the transaction revert as the USDC cannot be removed from rewardTokens.
  
## Test
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");
const { time } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

describe("SymmStaking Dust Reward Lock Vulnerability Test", function () {
  let admin, user;
  let SymmStaking, staking;
  let SYMM, symm;
  let USDC, usdc;

  before(async () => {
    [admin, user] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // deploy mock tokens 
    const ERC20Mock = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Mock");
    SYMM = await ERC20Mock.deploy("SYMM", "SYMM", 18);
    USDC = await ERC20Mock.deploy("USDC", "USDC", 6);
    await SYMM.deployed();
    await USDC.deployed();

    // then deploy staking contract
    const SymmStaking = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmStaking");
    staking = await upgrades.deployProxy(SymmStaking, [
      admin.address,
      SYMM.address
    ]);
    await staking.deployed();

    // setup role
    await staking.grantRole(await staking.REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE(), admin.address);
  });

  it("Should permanently block token removal with 11 wei residual rewards", async () => {
    // whitelist USDC as reward token
    await staking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(USDC.address, true);

    // 11 wei (0.000011 USDC) reward
    const dustAmount = 11;
    await USDC.mint(admin.address, dustAmount);
    await USDC.connect(admin).approve(staking.address, dustAmount);

    // notify reward as this add to pendingRewards
    await staking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount(
      [USDC.address],
      [dustAmount]
    );

    // fast forward past reward duration (1 week)
    await time.increase(604800 + 1); 

    // verify the pre removal state
    expect(await staking.isRewardToken(USDC.address)).to.be.true;
    const initialRewardTokens = await staking.rewardTokens();
    expect(initialRewardTokens).to.include(USDC.address);

    // attempt the removal but it supposed to revert due to 11 wei > 10 threshold
    await expect(
      staking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(USDC.address, false)
    ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
      staking,
      "OngoingRewardPeriodForToken"
    ).withArgs(USDC.address, 11);

    // validate the post removal state
    const finalRewardTokens = await staking.rewardTokens();
    expect(finalRewardTokens).to.include(USDC.address); // token is not removed
    expect(await staking.pendingRewards(USDC.address)).to.equal(dustAmount); // and the Reward unchanged
  });
});
```
## Output:
```text
  SymmStaking Dust Reward Lock Vulnerability Test
    Should permanently block token removal with 11 wei residual rewards

  1 passing 
```

## **Recommendations**

1. use a Percentage-Based Threshold
```solidity
// Allow removal if pending rewards < 0.1% of total rewards distributed
uint256 totalRewards = rewardState[token].rate * rewardState[token].duration;
if (pendingRewards[token] > (totalRewards / 1000)) revert(........);
```

2. maybe consider a Time-Based Allowance
```solidity
// it allow her removal after reward period ends regardless of dust
if (block.timestamp < rewardState[token].periodFinish) revert(..........);
```
3. increase the fixed threshold
```solidity
// Set threshold to 1e18 wei meaning 1 full token for 18-decimal assets
if (pendingRewards[token] > 1e18) revert(......);
```
