# Rounding Errors in Reward Distribution Cause Minor but Significant Reward Loss

### Summary

A rounding error in the staking reward distribution system leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual claimed rewards. Due to precision limitations in the division of reward tokens among stakers, users may receive slightly less than the full allocated reward, leading to a cumulative loss over multiple reward cycles.

Root Cause

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the way the staking contract calculates and distributes rewards. Since reward calculations often involve division (e.g., reward per token staked over time), integer division can introduce rounding errors. When rewards are computed in smaller fractions, the contract may truncate rather than round up, causing a small but cumulative loss in the distributed rewards.

Example of Rounding Issue:
User1 Deposits Tokens:
User1 stakes 500 tokens before rewards are notified.
Admin Notifies Rewards:
notifyRewardAmount is called with 100 reward tokens to be distributed over a set duration (e.g., 1 week).
Time Advances:
The system progresses through the full 1-week reward duration.
User1 Attempts to Claim Rewards:
The user expects to receive exactly 100 tokens.
Due to Rounding Errors:
The actual claimable amount may be slightly less than 100 tokens, depending on how reward distribution handles fractional values.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The staking contract uses integer division for calculating reward per staked token.
The rewards are distributed proportionally based on time and staked amount.
The contract does not compensate for rounding losses in fractional calculations.

### External Pre-conditions

No additional deposits or reward notifications interfere before the user claims rewards.
The staking contract does not use floating-point arithmetic (since Solidity only supports integer math).
The earned() function may round down rather than applying precise fractional adjustments.

### Attack Path

User1 stakes 500 tokens.
Admin notifies rewards:
100 reward tokens are allocated across all stakers.
Rewards accumulate over time, but due to integer math, the precise share per token may result in small fractions.
After a week, User1 calls claimRewards() and receives slightly less than 100 tokens due to rounding.
The discrepancy is small per user but can add up across multiple users and reward cycles, leading to systematic reward underpayment.


### Impact

Loss of Expected Rewards: Users receive slightly less than their fair share of rewards.
Cumulative Effect Over Time: Small losses add up over multiple distribution cycles, reducing the protocol's attractiveness to long-term stakers.
Economic Inefficiency: Lost rewards may remain unallocated within the contract, leading to unnecessary token accumulation.
