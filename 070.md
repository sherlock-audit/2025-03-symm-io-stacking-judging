# rewards will be diluted into perpetuity via regular `notifyRewardAmount` calls with 1 wei of each reward token

### Summary

Current notifyRewardAmount implementation [moves rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L378) to `block.timestamp : block.timestamp + 7 days` period every time it is called, and can be called as often as each block, and with values as small as 1 wei. Each such call will move a significant share of initial rewards into the future.

A griefer can call `notifyRewardAmount` twice a day for one week, which would delay the 35.4% of initial rewards for 7 days.  Calling more often will delay more rewards, up to `1/e` (or 36.78%) per week.

E.g. there's 1000 USDC rewards for week 1.

One week later, there will still be 354 USDC undistributed.

One more week later, there would be 354 * 0.354 USDC of initial rewards left (plus 35.4% of new rewards), and so on.

### Root Cause

Distribution end time and reward rate are recalculated every time `notifyRewardAmount` is called.

### Attack Path

Attacker regularly calls (e.g. twice a day) `notifyRewardAmount` with `amount = 1` for each whitelisted token he wants to grief.

### Impact

High: more than 1% and more than 10 USD of staking rewards will not be paid to stakers. In particular, 1% of rewards for the last week will not be distributed for more than 1 month.

### Mitigation

`notifyRewardAmount` should accumulate rewards until current distribution period has ended, and only then create new distribution period with accumulated rewards.
