# Potential Division-by-Zero Error in SymmVesting Contract's Liquidity Quote Calculation

### Summary

The `getLiquidityQuote` function within the SymmVesting contract calculates the required USDC amount for adding liquidity by dividing by the pool's SYMM balance. this function lacks a check to ensure the SYMM balance (symmBalance) is non-zero. This omission creates a division-by-zero, leading to transaction revert and a disruption of liquidity operations.



### Root Cause
The root of the issue lies in the following calculation within the `getLiquidityQuote` function:

```solidity
	function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
@>>		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
	}

```

The code does not include a necessary validation step to confirm that symmBalance is greater than zero before the division operation. Consequently, if symmBalance is zero, any call to addLiquidity or addLiquidityByPercentage will always revert due to the division-by-zero error.

### Attack Path
- An attacker could lead to a scenario where the pool's SYMM balance is reduced to zero. This could be achieved by strategically transferring or withdrawing SYMM tokens from the pool.
- When a user subsequently attempts to add liquidity, the division-by-zero error in the `getLiquidityQuote` calculation will be triggered, causing the transaction to revert.
- This inability to add liquidity can be exploited to create a DoS, preventing legitimate users from participating in liquidity addition.
- Malicious actors could continuously monitor and manipulate the SYMM balance to keep it at zero, effectively blocking all attempts to add liquidity.

### Impact

Users attempting to add liquidity will consistently encounter transaction reverts due to the division-by-zero error, effectively halting all liquidity operations.

A malicious actor could deliberately manipulate the pool's SYMM balance (e.g., by rapidly draining SYMM tokens) to induce a zero balance, creating a persistent denial-of-service (DoS) condition that prevents any liquidity from being added to the pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a require statement to check if the SYMM balance is greater than zero before performing the division operation. This will prevent the division-by-zero error and ensure the stability of the liquidity addition process. For example:

```solidity
require(symmBalance > 0, "SYMM balance is zero");
```
