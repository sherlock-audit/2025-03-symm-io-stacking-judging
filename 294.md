# Possible front-running on addLiquidity may affect regular LPs

### Summary

The `SymmVesting::addLiquidity` function can be front run. An attacker may be able observe a user's transaction to add liquidity and submit their own transaction with the same parameters but a higher gas price, ensuring that their transaction is mined first. This can lead to the user receiving fewer LP tokens or experiencing slippage, as the pool's state changes before their transaction is processed.

### Root Cause

The `addLiquidity` function does not account for the possibility of front-running. Also MEV bots will want to use this to benefit themselves because there isn't no tax or fee to deposit and become and Liquidity Provider by depositing into the pool and keep doing that without paying any fees to the protocol. And, of course you would still pay gas while depositing to the Symm pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The addLiquidity function relies on the current state of the pool to calculate the required USDC and expected LP tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L180

The pool's state can be changed by other transactions before the user's transaction is mined.

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker can observe pending transactions in the mempool.
The attacker has sufficient funds to execute the front-running transaction.
The user is attempting to add liquidity to the pool.

### Attack Path

1. The user submits a transaction to add liquidity to the pool.
2. The attacker observes the pending transaction in the mempool.
3. The attacker submits a transaction with the same parameters but a higher gas price.
4. The attacker's transaction is mined first, changing the state of the pool.
5. The user's transaction is mined with the updated pool state, resulting in fewer LP tokens or slippage.

### Impact

The user who wants to deposit and become an Liquidity Provider may receive an innacurate amount of returned tokens than expected due to the MEV bots hunting him, or attacker trying to do robbery by front-running innocent users, and economic losses like losing some tokens.

```
I created some mocks to be easier to interact, but i still call functions of symmVesting to show the exploit.

You can do a 

```bash
forge test --mt testFrontRunningAddLiquidity
```

### Mitigation

Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP): Implement TWAP to calculate the required USDC and expected LP tokens based on an average price over a period of time, reducing the impact of sudden price changes.
You can also use deadline parameters on `addLiquidity` function
