# `StakingRewards` reward rate can be dragged out and diluted

## Summary
The `SymmStaking` contract's `_addRewardsForToken` function recalculates the reward rate and extends the reward period each time new rewards are added. This mechanism can be exploited to dilute the reward rate by repeatedly adding minimal rewards, effectively extending the reward distribution period indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Details
In `SymmStaking.sol`,  when new rewards are added:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L369-L378
```javascript
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
The `StakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount` function receives a reward amount and  `_addRewardsForToken` extends the current reward end time to now + rewardsDuration.
It rebases the currently `remaining rewards + the new rewards (amount + leftover)` over this new `rewardsDuration` period.
This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

## Attack Scenario
1. Initial state: `state.rate` is 1000 tokens .
2. After 20% of duration passes:

   - `remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp` (80% of duration)(7-1.4 = 5.6 days)

   - `leftover = remaining * state.rate` ( 5.6 * 1000 ) 

3. Attacker calls with minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei):

   - New `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration ` ((1 + 5.6 * 1000) / 7) = 800

   - Rate drops by ~20%

4. This can be repeated to continuously dilute the rate.

## Proof Of Code
1. Use this guide to intergrate foundry into your project: [foundry]( https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-and-foundry)
2. Create a new file `FortisTest.t.sol` in the test directory.
3. Add the following code to the file .
4. Run the test using  `forge test --mt test_FortisStakingRewardRateCanBeDragged -vvvv`

## Recommendation
- The `rewardRate` should never decrease by a `notifyRewardAmount` call. 

- Consider not extending the reward payouts by `rewardsDuration` on every call.

- `periodFinish` probably shouldn't change at all, the ` rewardRate` should just increase by `state.rate += amount / (state.periodFinish - block.timestamp).`
