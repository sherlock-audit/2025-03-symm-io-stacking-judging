# SymmStaking.sol :: `lastTimeRewardApplicable()` Returns Zero When `periodFinish` Is Zero, giving incorrect Reward Calculations

### Summary

`lastTimeRewardApplicable()` is designed to return the appropriate timestamp for reward calculations. However, when `periodFinish` is set to zero, instead of handling this edge case properly, it returns zero as the applicable time. This zero timestamp is then used in `_updateRewardsStates()` which sets `state.lastUpdated = 0`, resulting in incorrect reward calculations across the entire staking system. This affects all core functions that depend on accurate time-based rewards, including `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `claimRewards`.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation when setting or updating the `periodFinish` parameter in reward state. The `lastTimeRewardApplicable()` function compares` block.timestamp` with `rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish`, but doesn't properly handle the case where `periodFinish` could be zero. you can see in the function below:
```solidity
	function lastTimeRewardApplicable(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return block.timestamp < rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish ? block.timestamp : rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish; //@audit what if i set period finish to 0?
	}
```
When `periodFinish` is zero, `block.timestamp` will always be greater than 0 , causing the function to return zero. This cascades through the reward distribution mechanism, particularly affecting the `_updateRewardsStates()` function which assigns this zero value to `state.lastUpdated` in the function
```solidity
function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

			state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
		     @>  state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token); 

			if (account != address(0)) {
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
which will affect the reward culculations by giving incorrect reward calculations

### Impact


Reward incorrect Calculation : The zero timestamp causes incorrect calculation in the `rewardPerToken()` and `earned()` functions, which will make the users receive less rewards or more rewards than intended.


### PoC

To better understand the problem, let's look at an example of how setting `periodFinish` to zero impacts reward calculations for users in the staking contract.
Normal Operation:

A staking pool is set up with REWARD token rewards and a `periodFinish` timestamp set to 30 days in the future.
User A stakes 1000 tokens into the pool.
When User A calls `claimRewards()`, the `_updateRewardsStates()` function uses:

`state.perTokenStored` = `rewardPerToken(token)`
`state.lastUpdated` = `lastTimeRewardApplicable()` (returns current time)`
rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token) (calculates correct rewards based on time elapsed)


User A receives the accurately calculated rewards based on their staking duration.

Exploited Scenario:

The same staking pool exists with REWARD token rewards, but an attacker or malicious user  sets `periodFinish` to 0.
User A stakes 1000 tokens into the pool.
User A calls `claimRewards()` which triggers `_updateRewardsStates()`:

`lastTimeRewardApplicable()` now returns 0 instead of the current time
`state.lastUpdated` is set to 0
`rewardPerToken(token) `calculation uses this zero value, returning an incorrect amount
`earned()` also uses corrupted time values, leading to incorrect reward calculation


Depending on the specific implementation of the reward calculation:

User A might receive no rewards at all (due to  time difference)
User A might receive excessive rewards (if zero values cause unexpected behavior in the math)
The `SymmStaking` contract might enter an inconsistent state where some users get rewards and others don't





### Mitigation

consider adding validation check in the lastTimeRewardApplicable() where periodFinish is greater than zero

```diff
function lastTimeRewardApplicable(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
+ require(periodFinish > 0 )
		return block.timestamp < rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish ? block.timestamp : rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish; 
	}
```
