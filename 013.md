# Missing Access Control on SymmStaking Admin Functions

### Summary

The `getLiquidityQuote` ([Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247)) function's calculation sequence leads to severe precision loss, causing users to receive significantly fewer LP tokens than they should.


### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting.sol:185-186`:
```solidity
usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```
The sequence of operations causes precision loss due to:
1. Integer division truncation
2. Large decimal scaling (1e30)
3. Multiplication after division

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must provide a large symmAmount
2. Pool must have significant imbalance between SYMM and USDC

### External Pre-conditions

The $SYMM and USDC tokens (assumed ERC-20) must use standard decimals: 18 for $SYMM and 6 for USDC, as implied by the test’s notation (`e18` and `e6`), affecting the precision of the math.





### Attack Path

1. User deposits 1,000,000 SYMM tokens
2. Pool state:
   - symmBalance = 10,000,000
   - usdcBalance = 5,000,000
3. Calculation steps:
   ```solidity
   // Step 1: (1,000,000 * 5,000,000) / 10,000,000 = 500,000
   usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
   
   // Step 2: (500,000 * 1e18) / 1e30 ≈ 0
   usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
   ```
4. Result: User receives 0 USDC quote due to precision loss

### Impact
Users suffer an approximate loss of their expected USDC value (e.g., 500,000 USDC per call), or more precisely, they cannot execute the intended action (e.g., redeeming $SYMM for USDC), as the function fails to provide a valid quote. No attacker gains directly; it’s a vulnerability blocking functionality. Also users receive might significantly fewer LP tokens than expected.


### PoC

```solidity
contract PrecisionLossTest {
    function testPrecisionLoss() public {
        uint256 symmAmount = 1_000_000e18;
        uint256 symmBalance = 10_000_000e18;
        uint256 usdcBalance = 5_000_000e6;
        
        // Expected result: 500,000 USDC
        // Actual result: 0 USDC
        uint256 usdcAmount = symmVesting.getLiquidityQuote(
            symmAmount
        );
        
        assertEq(usdcAmount, 0);
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

1. Multiply before dividing to preserve intermediate values.
2. Adjust for decimal differences explicitly (multiply by 1e12 to scale $SYMM’s 18 decimals down to USDC’s 6).
3. Ensure the result aligns with the expected ratio.

code:
```solidity
contract Vesting {
    IERC20 public symm;
    IERC20 public usdc;
    uint256 public symmBalance = 10_000_000e18;
    uint256 public usdcBalance = 5_000_000e6;

    function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Scale symmAmount to match USDC decimals (18 -> 6)
        uint256 adjustedSymmAmount = symmAmount / 1e12; // 1_000_000e18 -> 1_000_000e6
        // Step 2: Multiply first, then divide
        uint256 usdcAmount = (adjustedSymmAmount * usdcBalance) / (symmBalance / 1e12);
        return usdcAmount; // Returns 500_000e6 as expected
    }
}
```
