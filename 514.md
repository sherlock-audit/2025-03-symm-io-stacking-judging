# Incorrect formula in calculation prevents users from claiming full amount of their locked tokens

### Summary

Incorrect formula in calculation prevents users from claiming full amount of their locked tokens 

### Root Cause

In [Vesting.sol#L167-169](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L167-L169) and [Vesting.sol#L185-191](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L185-L191), users are expected to claim their locked tokens based on a percentage, passing 0 for 0% and 1 for 100%, as stated in the NatSpec comments.

However, there is an issue with the following expression:
``` solidity
(getLockedAmountsForToken(user, token) * percentage) / 1e18
```
Since the token amount is calculated as e18 * 1 / 1e18, it does not return the full token amount. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

///

### External Pre-conditions

///

### Attack Path

1. User has tokens locked in vesting
2. Users wants to claim 100% of locked tokens by calling `claimLockedTokenByPercentage()`, or asking operator to call `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage()`
3. User receives only a fraction of tokens he was supposed to receive or no tokens at all(if vesting amount < 1e18)


### Impact

User is not able to claim his funds with functions `claimLockedTokenByPercentage` and `claimLockedTokenForByPercentage`

        assertLt(symm.balanceOf(user1), 5000 * 10 ** 18);
        // instead he received 5000
        assertEq(symm.balanceOf(user1), 5000);
    }
}


```

### Mitigation

The correct formula should be:
```solidity
(getLockedAmountsForToken(user, token) * percentage * 1e18) / 1e18

This ensures proper scaling and prevents rounding errors that could result in incorrect token amounts being claimed.
