# User will extend vesting period for liquidity providers

### Summary

The incorrect setting of vesting start times in SymmVesting.sol will cause an extended vesting period for liquidity providers as the user will add liquidity late in the vesting schedule, leading to LP tokens being locked longer than expected.



### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol, the choice to set the vesting start time for LP tokens to block.timestamp while retaining the original SYMM vesting end time is a mistake as it extends the vesting duration for LP tokens when liquidity is added late in the original vesting period. Specifically, the _setupVestingPlans function uses:
solidity

_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);

If symmVestingPlan.endTime is near, the new vesting period for LP tokens (from block.timestamp to symmVestingPlan.endTime) could still be disproportionately long compared to the user's expectation, especially if the original vesting was almost complete.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing SYMM vesting plan to set startTime and endTime where the current block.timestamp is close to endTime (e.g., vesting is near completion).

2. User needs to call addLiquidity to convert a portion of their locked SYMM into SYMM LP tokens.

3. The LP vesting plan needs to be set up or reset to set the start time as block.timestamp and the end time as the original SYMM vesting endTime.



### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required, as this vulnerability arises solely from the internal logic of the SymmVesting.sol contract and the user's interaction with it.



### Attack Path

1. User has a SYMM vesting plan nearing its end (e.g., only 1 week remains until endTime).

2. User calls addLiquidity to convert some locked SYMM into SYMM LP tokens.

3. The _setupVestingPlans function is executed, setting up the LP vesting plan with:
- Start time: block.timestamp (current time)

-  End time: Original SYMM vesting endTime (e.g., 1 week from now)

4. LP tokens are locked for the full remaining duration, which might be longer than the user expects (e.g., 1 week starting now, despite the original vesting being nearly done).

5. The user faces an unexpectedly prolonged lockup for their LP tokens, delaying access to them.



### Impact

The liquidity providers (users adding liquidity) suffer an extended vesting period for their LP tokens, delaying their ability to claim or use these tokens by days, weeks, or months, depending on when they add liquidity. This could discourage users from providing liquidity, particularly late in the vesting schedule, due to the unexpectedly long lockup periods.
Example Calculation:
- Original SYMM vesting: Start time = Day 0, End time = Day 180 (6 months).

- User adds liquidity on Day 170: Only 10 days remain in the original vesting.

- LP tokens vesting: Start time = Day 170, End time = Day 180.

- Impact: LP tokens are locked for 10 days, which may feel unfairly long if the user expected a shorter lockup proportional to the remaining vesting time.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To avoid unfairly extending the vesting period for LP tokens, the vesting duration should be proportional to the remaining time in the original SYMM vesting plan. A practical solution is to calculate a new end time for LP tokens based on the elapsed portion of the original vesting period.
Proposed Solution:
Adjust the LP vesting end time dynamically:
  solidity
  uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - symmVestingPlan.startTime;
  uint256 totalDuration = symmVestingPlan.endTime - symmVestingPlan.startTime;
  uint256 remainingDuration = symmVestingPlan.endTime - block.timestamp;
  
  // Calculate a proportional end time for LP tokens
  uint256 lpEndTime = block.timestamp + remainingDuration;
  
  // Set up LP vesting with adjusted end time
  _setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, lpEndTime, users, amounts);
