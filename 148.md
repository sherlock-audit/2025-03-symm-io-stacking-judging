# Pending Rewards Not Updated in rescueTokens, Preventing Reward Token Removal

### Summary

The rescueTokens function allows the admin to withdraw unused tokens from the staking contract. However, it does not update pendingRewards[token], which causes inconsistencies in the reward tracking system. This prevents reward token removal due to the ineffective pendingRewards[token] > 10 condition in configureRewardToken.



### Root Cause

The function rescueTokens transfers tokens out of the contract without adjusting pendingRewards[token]. Since pendingRewards[token] remains unchanged, the condition in configureRewardToken (pendingRewards[token] > 10) will always be true when rewards have been rescued. As a result, reward tokens cannot be removed

```solidity
	function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}

	function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are no staked tokens, so rewards do not get distributed.
The admin calls rescueTokens to withdraw accumulated rewards.
pendingRewards[token] remains unchanged, despite the actual reward balance decreasing.


### External Pre-conditions

The admin calls rescueTokens to withdraw accumulated rewards.


### Attack Path

-

### Impact

Admins cannot remove reward  token

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When rescuing tokens: 
Before transferring tokens, adjust pendingRewards[token] -= amount to reflect the actual balance.
