# Precision loss when calculating rewardState.rate

### Summary

Precision loss when calculating `rewardState.rate`

### Root Cause

In the `SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken` function, precision loss occurs:
[SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379)
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
		
		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
		
		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

`rewardState.duration` is 1 week = 604800 seconds. When `notifyRewardAmount` is called If reward token is USDC or USDT which has 6 decimals, up to 604799 / 1e6 USDC can be lost (as if the amount was 604799 less). 604799 / 1e6 USDC = 0.6 USD lost to precision loss. 

This issue can be replicated in tokens with more decimals but more value such as WBTC in which the loss could be up to 0.006 WBTC (around 515 USD). That won't be distributed each distribution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Precision loss up to 515 USD

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Calculate the amount that won't get distributed and return it to the distributor.
