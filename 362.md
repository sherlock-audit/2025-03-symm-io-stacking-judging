# Critical Access Control Vulnerability in notifyRewardAmount

## Bug description
In [SymmStaking.sol#L275](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275)

The `notifyRewardAmount` function lacks proper access control restrictions. This function performs critical operations including token transfers and reward rate modifications, but can be called by any external address.

````solidity
```
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused {
    // Implementation
}
```
````
The function should be restricted to addresses with the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE`, which is defined in the contract but not applied to this function.


## Impact
This vulnerability undermines the entire reward management system and could lead to economic exploitation of the protocol.

## Recommended Mitigation

Add the missing access control modifier to restrict this function to authorized reward managers:
````solidity
```
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused
    onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE)  // Add this line
{
    // Existing implementation
}
```
````
This ensures that only addresses with the appropriate role can modify the reward system, maintaining the economic security of the staking protocol.
