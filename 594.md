# withdraw Function users lose unclaimed rewards

### Summary

The withdraw function allows users to unstake their tokens but does not account for pending rewards before reducing the staked balance. This results in a scenario where users lose unclaimed rewards if they withdraw their entire staked amount before claiming them.

### Root Cause

User stakes tokens in the staking contract.
User accumulates staking rewards over time.
User calls withdraw(amount), where amount is equal to their full staked balance.
balanceOf[msg.sender] is reduced to 0 before the user claims their rewards.
The earned function calculates rewards based on balanceOf[msg.sender], which is now 0, causing rewards to be lost.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Reduced trust in the staking contract, leading to lower participation.

Users lose staking rewards unintentionally.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Before updating balanceOf[msg.sender], call a function to claim pending rewards:

function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant updateReward(msg.sender) {
    if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);

    _claimRewardsFor(msg.sender);  // Ensure rewards are claimed before balance is reset

    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    totalSupply -= amount;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;

    emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount, to);
}
