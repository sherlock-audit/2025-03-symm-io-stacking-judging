# Insufficient Balance for Penalty Transfer Leading to Partial Fund Loss

### Summary

The missing balance check for the penalty in [_claimLockedToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281) will cause a partial loss of funds for the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`, as if the caller requests the exact amount of tokens available in the contract, only their portion of the claim will be successfully transferred, while the penalty transfer fails.

### Root Cause

In `_claimLockedToken`, the function `_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount)`; ensures the contract has enough tokens to send amount but does not check whether the contract has enough tokens to cover the penalty. If the contract balance is exactly amount, the first transfer (amount - penalty) succeeds, while the second (penalty) fails.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract balance must be exactly amount before _claimLockedToken is called.
2. The function _ensureSufficientBalance does not account for penalty.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The ERC-20 token must not revert the entire transaction if a transfer fails due to insufficient balance (e.g., behaves like standard ERC-20).

### Attack Path

1 .The user ensures the contract has exactly amount tokens but not amount + penalty.
2. The user calls _claimLockedToken(token, user, amount).
3. The contract:
Transfers amount - penalty to the user ✅ (successful).
Tries to transfer penalty to lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver ❌ (fails due to insufficient balance).

### Impact

- The lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver does not receive the penalty.
- The protocol loses the penalty amount.
- Users can systematically bypass penalties, claiming more than they should.


### PoC

```Solidity
function testBypassPenalty() public {
    uint256 claimAmount = 100e18; // Example claim amount
    uint256 penalty = (claimAmount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

    // Ensure contract has exactly `claimAmount`, not `claimAmount + penalty`
    deal(address(token), address(vestingContract), claimAmount);

    // User claims, first transfer succeeds, second one fails
    vm.prank(user);
    vestingContract.claimLockedToken(address(token), user, claimAmount);

    // Assert user received their portion
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(user), claimAmount - penalty);
    
    // Assert penalty was never transferred
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver), 0);
}

```

### Mitigation

Modify _ensureSufficientBalance to ensure it accounts for both amount and penalty:
```Solidity
_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount + penalty);
```
