# Vesting should not use the initializer modifier

### Summary

`Vesting` is a contract that intended to be inherited by `SymmVesting`, therefore. it's initializer function should not use the `initializer` modifier, instead, it should use `onlyInitializing` modifier.

[Vesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L76-L91)

```solidity
	function __vesting_init(address admin, uint256 _lockedClaimPenalty, address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver) public initializer {
		__AccessControlEnumerable_init();
		__Pausable_init();
		__ReentrancyGuard_init();

		lockedClaimPenalty = _lockedClaimPenalty;
		lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver = _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver;

		if (admin == address(0) || _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

		_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, admin);
		_grantRole(OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);
	}
```

### Root Cause

In the `Vesting` contract, the initialize function uses the initializer modifier. This is incorrect for a contract like `Vesting`, which is meant to be inherited by other contracts, such as `SymmVesting`.

In this inheritance model, the `SymmVesting` contract also has its own initialize function, which includes the initializer modifier and calls the initialize function of `Vesting`. The problem here is that both the parent contract `Vesting` and the child contract `Vesting` are using the `initializer` modifier, which limits initialization to only one call.

[SymmVesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L55C1-L86C11)

```solidity
	function initialize(
		address admin,
		address _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver,
		address _pool,
		address _router,
		address _permit2,
		address _vault,
		address _symm,
		address _usdc,
		address _symm_lp
	) public initializer {
		if (
			admin == address(0) ||
			_lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver == address(0) ||
			_pool == address(0) ||
			_router == address(0) ||
			_permit2 == address(0) ||
			_vault == address(0) ||
			_symm == address(0) ||
			_usdc == address(0) ||
			_symm_lp == address(0)
		) revert ZeroAddress();
		__vesting_init(admin, 500000000000000000, _lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver);
		POOL = IPool(_pool);
		ROUTER = IRouter(_router);
		PERMIT2 = IPermit2(_permit2);
		VAULT = _vault;
		SYMM = _symm;
		USDC = _usdc;
		SYMM_LP = _symm_lp;
	}

```

According to the [OpenZeppelin documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer--), the [onlyInitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-onlyInitializing--) modifier should be used to allow initialization in both the parent and child contracts. The  [onlyInitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-onlyInitializing--) modifier ensures that when the initialize function is called, any contracts in its inheritance chain can still complete their own initialization.

<https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer-->

> > A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once. In its scope, onlyInitializing functions can be used to initialize parent contracts.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The vulnerability causes a significant operational issue, preventing inheriting contracts from completing initialization. This could lead to a failure in the deployment of critical protocol components, affecting the overall system functionality.


### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Replace the initializer modifier in the `Vesting` contract with the onlyInitializing modifier. This allows the initialize function to be used by both the MasterAMO and any inheriting contracts during their initialization phase, without conflicting with their individual setup processes.
