# Default Slippage check when adding Liquidity is too strict

### Summary

Reliance on the contract’s on‑chain token balances for liquidity quoting will cause a liquidity provisioning failure for users with 0 slippage protection, as an attacker can unbalance these internal balances by transferring extra tokens to the contract. In effect, an attacker will be able to block liquidity additions (a griefing attack) because the computed token ratio no longer matches the pool’s reserve ratio.

### Root Cause

**Code Reference**: In ``_addLiquidity``, the function calls ``getLiquidityQuote(symmIn)`` which uses the contract’s current `USDC` and `SYMM` balances (via `POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances()`) to compute the required amounts.
**Issue**: The code assumes that the tokens held in the contract are “balanced” with respect to the pool’s reserve ratio. However, this assumption is flawed because external actors can send additional `USDC` or `SYMM` directly to the contract.
**Result**: Such external transfers can alter the contract’s internal balance, making the calculated amounts (especially usdcIn for liquidity) incorrect relative to the pool’s actual reserve ratio.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The liquidity quote is derived using the contract’s token balances (which come from `POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances()` and are assumed to be balanced).
2. The default slippage control is hardcoded (`1%` default via (`expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100`), which offers no flexibility if the balance ratio is shifted.


### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker must be able to transfer `USDC` or `SYMM` tokens directly to the contract’s address.
2. The token contracts (`USDC` and `SYMM`) allow anyone to transfer tokens without restrictions.
3. Market conditions do not automatically rebalance the contract’s token holdings, so the unbalance remains until a liquidity addition is attempted.


### Attack Path


1. **Pre-Attack Setup**:
 The contract holds a “balanced” amount of `SYMM` and `USDC` according to the pool’s reserve ratio.
2. **Attacker Action**:
The attacker sends extra `USDC` (or `SYMM`) directly to the contract, thereby increasing the balance of one token relative to the other.
3. **Triggering the Failure**:
When a user calls `_addLiquidity`, the `getLiquidityQuote` function uses the manipulated balances to calculate the required `USDC` and expected LP tokens.
Because the internal ratio is now skewed, the computed `usdcIn` does not match the actual ratio in the pool.
4. **Result**:
The liquidity call (via `ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional)` reverts due to slippage protection (or because the provided amounts no longer meet the pool’s ratio requirements), denying liquidity provisioning.


### Impact

Users who wish to add liquidity without any slippage parameter  experience failed transactionsaccept a small resulting in a denial of service (DoS) for liquidity provisioning.

		amountsIn[0] = symmIn;
		amountsIn[1] = usdcIn;

		uint256 initialLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));

		// Call the router to add liquidity.
		amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
			address(POOL),
			amountsIn,
			expectedLpAmount,
			false, // wethIsEth: bool
			"" // userData: bytes
		);

		// Return unused usdc
		if (usdcIn - amountsIn[1] > 0) usdc.safeTransfer(msg.sender, usdcIn - amountsIn[1]);

		// Calculate actual LP tokens received by comparing balances.
		uint256 newLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));
		lpAmount = newLpBalance - initialLpBalance;

		if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
	}
```

### Mitigation

The hardcoded slippage parameter should be removed, since user have the flexibility of specifying an amount they are comfortable with
