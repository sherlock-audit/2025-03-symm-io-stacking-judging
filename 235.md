# A Malicious User Can Infinitely Extend The Reward Distribution Period

### Summary

The lack of access control on the `notifyRewardAmount` function allows any user to repeatedly extend the reward distribution period indefinitely. This will cause an unintended prolonged reward period for the protocol as a malicious actor can continuously call `notifyRewardAmount` with minimal token deposits, preventing the reward distribution from ending.

### Root Cause

In `notifyRewardAmount`, any user can call the function with a minimal amount of tokens, which updates the reward period finish time via `_addRewardsForToken`. This resets `state.periodFinish` to `block.timestamp` + `state.duration`, effectively extending the reward distribution indefinitely.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin first calls `configureRewardToken` setting up a reward distribution with a duration of 1 week.

in line 24 `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` is hardcoded to 1 week;

By calling the `configureRewardToken` function the admin sets the duration to 1 week.

2. The reward token must be whitelisted via `configureRewardToken()`.
3. `notifyRewardAmount()` must be callable by anyone (no role restriction).

### External Pre-conditions

1. A malicious actor must have a small amount of the reward token to repeatedly call `notifyRewardAmount()`.
2. The actor must be able to execute the function at least once per week to prevent the reward period from expiring.

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets up a special 1-week reward distribution.
2. Malicious user calls `notifyRewardAmount([token], [1 wei])`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292
3. `_addRewardsForToken` extends the reward period by another 1 week.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379
- this line resets the Duration period
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378
4. The attacker repeats this process every hour, ensuring the reward never expires.### Impact

If admins make 1 week special reward distribution users can extend it to more than a month or an indefinite period of time. The protocol's reward system suffers indefinite extension of reward distribution, preventing the expected expiration of the reward period which could lead to near infinite distribution period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Restrict `notifyRewardAmount` to only the `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to prevent unauthorized extensions.
- Introduce a minimum reward amount threshold to prevent micro-deposits from triggering a reset.
- Implement a maximum extension limit, preventing reward distribution from being extended beyond a reasonable timeframe.
