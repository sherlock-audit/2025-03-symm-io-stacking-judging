# Blacklisted user may cause claimUnlockedToken() or claimLockedToken() to revert

### Summary

`Vesting` contract deals with `USDC`, which has blacklist functionalities, a blacklisted userâ€™s claim transactions will revert.

### Root Cause

If a user is blacklisted, any transfer() or transferFrom() call to/from their address will revert.
In claimUnlockedToken() and claimLockedToken(), the contract directly transfers tokens:

If USDC is used as the token, and a user is blacklisted, this function will always revert when trying to transfer funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has claimable unlocked or locked tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

The user is blacklisted in the USDC contract (or another token with blacklist functionality).
The vesting contract tries to transfer USDC to the user.

### Attack Path

The user has vested USDC in the contract.
The user gets blacklisted by Circle (USDC issuer).
The user tries to claim unlocked or locked tokens.
The transfer() call reverts, and they cannot claim their funds.

### Impact

Users who are blacklisted by USDC will lose access to their vested funds.
Core functions are disrupted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adds a recipient address in the function, so claim can be available.
