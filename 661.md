# Anyone can call the notifyRewardAmount function to manuplate the rewards distribution time

### Summary

The notifyRewardAmount function in SymmStaking.sol anyone can call it to increase the reward duration time. The protocol team cannot control the duration of staking rewards.

### Root Cause

The notifyRewardAmount function lacks proper access control, allowing anyone to call it.

The reward distribution duration increases when anyone calls the function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reward distribution process should remain active and ongoing.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A sufficient amount of time should have elapsed during the rewards distribution period.

### Attack Path

1.) While the reward duration is active, anyone can call notifyRewardAmount with a small reward token, thereby extending the reward distribution time by the default duration.


### Impact

1.) Since anyone can arbitrarily extend the reward distribution duration, it will disrupt the reward distribution process.
