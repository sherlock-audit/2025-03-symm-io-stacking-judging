# Immediate Vesting of LP Tokens via Expired Vesting Plan

### Summary

The `SymmVesting` contract has a vulnerability in which LP token vesting mechanism where users can bypass vesting schedules by adding liquidity to expired vesting plans. This allows immediate withdrawal of newly added LP tokens, violating the protocol's token lockup requirements.
## Affected code
```solidity
if (lpVestingPlan.isSetup()) {
    _resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts);
} else {
    _setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
}
```

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L158
The vulnerability arises from two key issues:
1. Static End Time Retention: When resetting existing LP vesting plans `_resetVestingPlans`, the contract updates locked amounts but preserves the original vesting end time

2. Expired Plan Inheritance: New LP tokens are added to existing vesting plans without checking if the plan's timeframe has expired.
The major root cause of this issue is the lack of `endTime` validation during vesting plan updates. When users add liquidity after their original vesting period has expired:
- New LP tokens inherit the expired vesting schedule
- The entire LP balance becomes immediately vested
- Users can withdraw 100% of LP tokens despite protocol lockup intentions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No response

### External Pre-conditions

No response

### Attack Path

```solidity
## Initial Setup
- Admin creates SYMM vesting plan (Start: T0, End: T0 + 30 days)
- User adds liquidity at T0 + 1 day
- LP vesting plan created matching SYMM end time (T0 + 30 days)

## Time Advancement
- Fast-forward to T0 + 31 days (post vesting period)

## Malicious Action
- User adds new liquidity:
Contract resets existing LP vesting plan:
Increases locked amount
Preserves expired end time (T0 + 30 days)

## 
```

### Impact

High because it allows for Complete bypass of vesting schedule for LP tokens

### PoC

No response but can be provided if needed.

### Mitigation

Fix the dynamic endTime updates in the `_addLiquidityProcess` function
```diff
if (lpVestingPlan.isSetup()) {
    // Extend vesting period if expired
+    if (block.timestamp > lpVestingPlan.endTime) {
        _setupVestingPlans(
            SYMM_LP,
            block.timestamp,
+    block.timestamp + (lpVestingPlan.endTime - lpVestingPlan.startTime),
            users,
            amounts
        );
    } else {
+    _resetVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, users, amounts);
    }
} else {
    _setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
}
```
