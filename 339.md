# `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` can't be changed, causing reverts if blacklisted

### Summary

If `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` is blacklisted, _claimLockedToken() will always revert, and there is no way to update this address.

### Root Cause

The contract transfers penalties to `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` in _claimLockedToken():
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L296
If lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver is blacklisted (e.g., by USDC):
This transfer will always revert.
All calls to _claimLockedToken() will fail, affecting every user.
There is no function to update lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver:
Once set in __vesting_init(), it can't be changed.


### Internal Pre-conditions

User calls claimLockedToken().

### External Pre-conditions

`lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` is blacklisted.
The `Vesting` contract tries to transfer USDC to the `lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver`.

### Attack Path

The user has vested USDC in the contract.
`lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver` gets blacklisted by Circle (USDC issuer).
The user tries to claim locked tokens.
The transfer() call reverts, and they cannot claim their funds.

### Impact

Users will be unable to claim locked tokens, permanently trapping their funds.
Core function is disrupted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow an admin to update lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver if it becomes blacklisted:
```solidity
function updateLockedClaimPenaltyReceiver(address newReceiver) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (newReceiver == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver = newReceiver;
}
```
