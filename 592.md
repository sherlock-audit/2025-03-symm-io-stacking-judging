# Lack of Access Control in SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()

### Summary

The notifyRewardAmount function lacks access control, allowing any external address to call it. This function is critical as it updates reward states and transfers tokens into the contract. The absence of access control exposes the contract to significant risks.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275

The root cause of the issue is the absence of access control on the notifyRewardAmount function, which allows any external address to call it. This function is critical as it:

Transfers tokens into the contract using safeTransferFrom.

Updates the reward state by calling _addRewardsForToken.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. No admin restriction

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker needs to approve small amonts of tokens for this to happen

### Attack Path

Step 1: Identify the Vulnerability
The attacker notices that the notifyRewardAmount function is callable by any external address and lacks access control.

The function allows the caller to specify tokens and amounts, which are used to update the reward state and transfer tokens into the contract.

Step 2: Prepare the Attack
Obtain a Whitelisted Token:

The attacker identifies a token that is whitelisted (isRewardToken[token] == true).

If the attacker does not own the token, they may trick another user into approving the contract to spend their tokens.

Set Up a Malicious Contract or EOA:

The attacker prepares an externally owned account (EOA) or a malicious contract to call notifyRewardAmount.

Step 3: Exploit the Vulnerability
Call notifyRewardAmount:

The attacker calls notifyRewardAmount with whitelisted tokens and an arbitrary amount.

Example:

```solidity
notifyRewardAmount([whitelistedToken], [Amount]);
```
Transfer Tokens to the Contract:

The function uses safeTransferFrom to transfer amount of the token from the attacker’s address to the contract.

If the attacker does not have sufficient tokens, they may exploit token approvals from other users.

Update Reward State:

The function calls _addRewardsForToken, which:

Resets the reward rate (state.rate) based on the provided amount.

Resets state.lastUpdated and state.periodFinish, even if the reward period hasn’t ended.

### Repeat the Attack:

The attacker repeatedly calls notifyRewardAmount to:

Manipulate the reward rate ```(state.rate)```.

Extend the reward period indefinitely by resetting state.periodFinish.

Step 4: Achieve the Attack Goals
Manipulate Reward Distribution:

By setting a high amount, the attacker inflates the reward rate, causing legitimate users to receive fewer rewards than expected.

By resetting state.periodFinish, the attacker disrupts the reward schedule, potentially locking rewards for legitimate users.

### Impact

The``` _addRewardsForToken``` function resets the reward state (state.lastUpdated and state.periodFinish) even when the reward period hasn't ended. A malicious actor can repeatedly call notifyRewardAmount to:

Reset reward rates, causing inconsistencies in reward calculations.

Extend reward periods indefinitely, disrupting the tokenomics of the system.

Any user can call ```notifyRewardAmount``` and manipulate reward rates by passing  ```Rewardtokens``` and amounts.

This can disrupt the intended reward distribution mechanism, leading to unfair advantages or losses for legitimate users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict ```notifyRewardAmount``` to authorized REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE.
