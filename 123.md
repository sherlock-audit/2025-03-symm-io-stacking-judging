# Users may fail to add liquidity

### Summary

Users may fail to add liquidity because of the improper amount check in `_resetVestingPlans`.

### Root Cause

In [Vesting::_resetVestingPlans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L222-L237), when we try to reset one vesting plan, we will have one check, `amount >= unlockedAmount()`.

Confirming with the sponsor about this check, the answer is as below:
```bash
That condition was written with the assumption that the period would not be reset and the start time would remain unchanged. However, later in the code, we actually did reset it, making that condition no longer relevant.
```
So the check exists because we do not change the vesting period's start time based on the initial design. So this check makes sense based on this design. However, in the actual implementation, we change the vesting period's start time. Based on current implementation, the check will make some normal behaviors dos.

For example:
1. Admin creates one vesting plan for Alice.
2. Alice adds 70% locked SYMM into the liquidity pool. Assume the LP amount is 700.
3. After one period of time, 350 LP can be unlocked.
4. Alice wants to add the remaining locked SYMM token into the liquidity, assume the LP amount is 150. Alice cannot add the remaining locked SYMM into the liquidity because the new LP amount is less than unlocked SYMM_LP amount.

```solidity
	function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
		uint256 len = users.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address user = users[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
@>			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
		}
	}
```

### Attack Path

1. Admin creates one vesting plan for Alice.
2. Alice adds 70% locked SYMM into the liquidity pool. Assume the LP amount is 700.
3. After one period of time, 350 LP can be unlocked.
4. Alice wants to add the remaining locked SYMM token into the liquidity, assume the LP amount is 150. Alice cannot add the remaining locked SYMM into the liquidity because the new LP amount is less than unlocked SYMM_LP amount.

### Impact

Users may fail to add their locked SYMM token into the liquidity if they've already added one part of locked SYMM into the liquidity.

### Mitigation

The check in function _resetVestingPlans() is based on the draft design, not current implementation. Remove this un-relevant check.
