# Time-Based LP Vesting Manipulation in SymmVesting Contract

### Summary

An incorrect vesting period inheritance in `SymmVesting.sol` will cause unfair vesting duration advantages for LP providers as users can exploit the contract to get significantly shorter vesting periods by providing liquidity near the end of their SYMM vesting schedule.


### Root Cause

In `SymmVesting.sol:_addLiquidityProcess()` the LP token vesting incorrectly inherits the end time from the SYMM vesting plan instead of enforcing a fixed duration:


In `_setupVestingPlans()`, there is no validation of the time difference between `startTime` and `endTime`:
```solidity
function _setupVestingPlans(address token, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, ...) internal {
// No validation that endTime - startTime >= MINIMUM_VESTING_DURATION
vestingPlan.setup(amount, startTime, endTime);
}
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have an existing SYMM vesting plan that is near its end date
2. User must have enough USDC to provide liquidity
3. `symmVestingPlan.endTime` must be less than `block.timestamp + intended_vesting_duration`


### External Pre-conditions

None


### Attack Path

1. Attacker waits until near the end of their SYMM vesting period (e.g. 1 month remaining)
2. Attacker calls `addLiquidity()` with most of their remaining locked SYMM
3. New LP tokens inherit the short remaining vesting duration instead of full 6/9 months
4. After short vesting ends, attacker can remove liquidity
5. Effectively bypassed intended vesting duration by 5-8 months


### Impact

The protocol suffers from an economic design violation where late LP providers get unfairly shorter vesting periods. Users can bypass 5-8 months of intended vesting duration, undermining the tokenomics goal of "long-term commitment and ecosystem stability".


### PoC

```solidity
contract TestVestingDurationExploit {
    function testShortVesting() public {
        // Setup: User has 1000 SYMM vesting until Aug 23, 2025
        vm.warp(1735689600); // July 23, 2025
        
        uint256 amount = 900;
        vesting.addLiquidity(
            amount,
            0,
            type(uint256).max
        );
        
        // Verify LP vesting period
        VestingPlan memory lpPlan = vesting.vestingPlans(
            SYMM_LP,
            address(this)
        );
        
        // LP vesting ends in 1 month instead of 6-9 months
        assertEq(
            lpPlan.endTime - lpPlan.startTime,
            30 days // ~1 month
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Enforce fixed vesting duration for LP tokens regardless of remaining SYMM vesting time:

```solidity
function _addLiquidityProcess(...) internal {
    // ...
    uint256 vestingDuration = 180 days; // 6 months
    _setupVestingPlans(
        SYMM_LP,
        block.timestamp, 
        block.timestamp + vestingDuration,
        users,
        amounts
    );
}
```

and also in the __setupVestingPlans

```solidity
function _setupVestingPlans(
    address token,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 endTime,
    address[] memory users,
    uint256[] memory amounts
) internal {
    // Add minimum duration check
    uint256 MINIMUM_VESTING_DURATION = 180 days; // 6 months
    if (endTime - startTime < MINIMUM_VESTING_DURATION) 
        revert VestingDurationTooShort();
        
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        totalVested[token] += amount;
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        vestingPlan.setup(amount, startTime, endTime);
        emit VestingPlanSetup(token, user, amount, startTime, endTime);
    }
}
```
