# Slippage Protection Bypass via Low minLpAmount Value

### Summary

The` addLiquidity` function allows users to set `minLpAmount` to values as low as 1 wei, disabling the protocol’s default 1% slippage protection. While not directly exploitable by attackers, this design flaw exposes users to unnecessary risks if they misunderstand or misuse the parameter, potentially resulting in significant losses due to normal market volatility or opportunistic price fluctuations.

### Root Cause

in the [`SymmVesting.sol#177`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L177) slippage logic prioritizes user input over safe defaults:
```solidity
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
```
If `minLpAmount` is non-zero (even trivially small), the protocol **fully disables slippage safeguards**, relying entirely on user judgment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

1. User Losses: Users might receive far fewer LP tokens than expected during pool volatility.
2. Misaligned Incentives: Creates a poor user experience, as the protocol’s "default" protection is easily overridden.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum slippage threshold to override risky user inputs:
```solidity
uint256 defaultSlippage = (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // 1% slippage
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > defaultSlippage ? minLpAmount : defaultSlippage;
```
