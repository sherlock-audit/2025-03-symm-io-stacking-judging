# The reward per token stored can be prevented from being updated

### Summary

The reward per token stored can be prevented from being updated/incremented due to precision loss issues. Please check the root cause for more details.

### Root Cause

The `_updateRewardsStates` function updates the `perTokenStored` and the associated timestamp `lastUpdate` time. Based on these values, the earned rewards of stakers can be computed and subsequently claimed.

In the `rewardPerToken` calculation:

```solidity
	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}

	function lastTimeRewardApplicable(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		return block.timestamp < rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish ? block.timestamp : rewardState[_rewardsToken].periodFinish;
	}
```

Look at this calculation:

```solidity
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
```

If the `((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18)` < `totalSupply`, then the resulting calculation will be 0 and the `perTokenStored` will not be updated. This could happen in various ways.

For example, we know that the protocol intends on using USDC as a reward token - https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1347584645310451803/1347956948733267989

Let's say that the reward duration was 1 week. Let's say notifyReward is called with 1000 USDC. So, the rate will be -

`amount / duration = 1000 * 1e6 / 604800 = 1653`

Let's say that an attacker deposits a minimal amount (could be 1 wei) in one block and withdraws his stake in the very next block. Note that `_updateRewardsStates` is called for every deposit and withdraw transaction. So, for the withdrawal transaction, as the deposit transaction has already updated `lastUpdated` in the previous block, the difference `lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated)` will only be 2 seconds, which is the avg. block time on Base. Therefore, for the calculation noted above, the numerator will be - `2 * 1653 * 1e18`

If the denominator is greater than the numerator, which is very likely to happen as SYMM will be used as staking token and hence the totalSupply will have 18 decimals. So, if in this example, the totalSupply of the staking token in this contract is as low as `2 * 1653 * 1e18 + 1`, the resulting calculation will be 0. And hence the reward per token will not be updated.

The attacker can keep depositing and withdrawing alternatively for each block such that the difference - `lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated` is only 2 seconds. This would ensure that the numerator is a small number and if the `totalSupply` is a big value, then the reward per token will not be updated.

There is another thing to consider.

We need to note that an attacker can manipulate the difference `lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated` and also the reward rate. This is another bug in the system, which an attacker can exploit. Since anybody can call `notifyReward` with any amount of token, it will decrease the reward rate as the period finish of the reward cycle gets extended. Since `rewardRate` becomes small, the attacker can manipulate the second part of the numerator of the above calculation as well, resulting in a smaller numerator.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`totalSupply` is a bigger value compared to `((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18)`. The numerator can be easily manipulated to ensure this happens.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Mentioned in the root cause.

### Impact

The reward per token stored can be stopped from incrementing, resulting in the users earning less rewards.

### PoC

The calculation above could be updated to consider the remainder amount -

```solidity
(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply) 

+ 

((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) % totalSupply);
```
