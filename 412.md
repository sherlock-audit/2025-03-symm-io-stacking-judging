# Incorrect constraint in resetVestingPlans() blocks admin and users from using acceptable amounts

## Description
When `resetVestingPlans() --> _resetVestingPlans()` is called the [following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231) is not required as it stops admin from setting acceptable amounts:
```diff
  File: token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol

   222:          	function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
   223:          		if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
   224:          		uint256 len = users.length;
   225:          		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
   226:          			address user = users[i];
   227:          			uint256 amount = amounts[i];
   228:          			// Claim any unlocked tokens before resetting.
   229:          			_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
   230:          			VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
-  231:          			if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
   232:          			uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
   233:          			vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
   234:          			totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
   235:          			emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
   236:          		}
   237:          	}
```

Here's the underlying mechanics:
1. On L229 we call `_claimUnlockedToken(token, user)` to claim all pending unlocked tokens yet to be claimed. What remains now is just the locked amount.
2. On L233 we call  `vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount)` which overwrites this remaining locked amount and has nothing to do with the already unlocked amount:
```solidity
  File: token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol

    71:          	function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    72:          		if (claimable(self) != 0) revert ShouldClaimFirst();
    73:          		if (!isSetup(self)) revert ShouldSetupFirst();
    74:          		// Rebase the vesting plan from now.
    75:          		uint256 remaining = remainingDuration(self);
    76:          		if (remaining == 0) revert PlanIsFinished();
    77:          		self.startTime = block.timestamp;
    78:          		self.endTime = block.timestamp + remaining;
    79:@--->     		self.amount = amount;
    80:          		self.claimedAmount = 0;
    81:          		return self;
    82:          	}
```
3. Hence the check on L231 about the new `amount` being greater than `vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()` makes no sense and rather blocks the admins from using acceptable values. Example:
    - In a vesting duration of 10 days, the total amount is 100.
    - After 7 days, admin calls `resetVestingPlans()` with `amount` as 50.
    - The unlocked amount thus far is `7/10 * 100 = 70`. Since `50 < 70`, this would revert, which makes little sense. The admin can't reduce the remaining amount at all, or even increase it unless it is greater than 70.

## Impact
1. Admin can't call `resetVestingPlans()` with acceptable values.

2. Whenever a user intends to call `addLiquidity()` --> [_addLiquidityProcess() --> _resetVestingPlans()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L156) their tx can revert if their `amount` value results in an `lpVestingPlan.lockedAmount() + lpAmount` which is less than the unlocked `SYMM_LP` amount. A valid attempt at adding liquidity would fail. (This would happen if they already added liquidity once and are attempting to do so once again after some duration of time has passed).


## Mitigation
Remove the check from inside `_resetVestingPlans()` as shown above.
