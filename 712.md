# Attacker can prevent distribution of USDC to stakers through frequent reward updates

### Summary

USDC's lower precision of 6 decimals and frequent reward updates could cause stakers to receive 0 of the allocated USDC rewards.

### Root Cause

 Using the same [reward-per-token calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200) for USDC is a mistake as USDC only has 6 decimals of precision compared to Symm's 18 decimals.**

### Internal Pre-conditions

        1. The rewards duration is one week. This is the default and a non-changeable duration.
        2. The user providing the rewards around 1_000e6 USDC of rewards to `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`.
        3. There is at least 50_000e18 amount staked in `SymmStaking`.


### External Pre-conditions

 > Similar to internal pre-conditions but it describes changes in the external protocols

### Attack Path

 1. The rewards sends 1_000e6 USDC to `SymmStaking` via `notifyRewardAmount()`. The reward rate is now equal 1653 (`1_000e6 / 1 weeks`). This is scheduled to happen every week.
        2. Every 1 to 2 blocks, the attacker will trigger an update of rewards by calling stake or unstake in `SymmStaking`. The reward-per-token for USDC is calculated:
        3. 
```solidity
                ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated)
                        * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply
 ```
  When 2 blocks have passed, the time since the last update would be 4 seconds because block time in Base is 2 seconds per block.

```solidity
          (4 * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply
```
since reward rate is 1653, the reward-per-token is 0.000000
        Note that the attacker does not need to update rewards every 1-2 blocks if there is organic activity on every block from users interacting with the contract and trigger the rewards update.

### Impact

 All stakers will receive 0 USDC when rewards are in bad proportion of the total supply(the total supply is big while the reward amount is low).

### PoC

The `precision loss when distributing USDC rewards` test can be added to `symmStaking.behavior.ts` under the describe of `Reward Calculation`
```javascript
          it("precision loss when distributing USDC rewards", async function () {
            // deposit 1m tokens
            // this could be deposited from multiple accounts with the total sum being between 100_000-1M
            const depositAmount = ethers.parseEther("100000")
            //this distributes 1e18 tokens per second
            const rewardAmountInUSDCDecimals = ethers.parseUnits("6048", 6)
            await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(admin.address, rewardAmountInUSDCDecimals)
            await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmountInUSDCDecimals)
            await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)

            //user deposit before notifying for the reward amount
            await stakingToken.connect(admin).mint(user1.address, BigInt(604800) + depositAmount)
            await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
            await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

            await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmountInUSDCDecimals])

            // increase with one week 
            // this is 60*60*24*7 = 604800 seconds
            // to ease the calculation we will instead run it for the first 1/1000 of the week
            // which is around the first 10 minutes
            const timeToInreaseWith = 1
            for (let i = 0; i < 604; i += timeToInreaseWith) {
              await time.increase(timeToInreaseWith)
              var rewardPerToken = await symmStaking.rewardPerToken(await stakingToken.getAddress())
              expect(rewardPerToken).to.be.equal(0)

              // trigger last update time to be updated to current timestamp
              await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), 1)
              await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(1, user1.address)
            }

            //no rewards have been distributed during the reward period
            var rewardPerToken = await symmStaking.rewardPerToken(await stakingToken.getAddress())
            expect(rewardPerToken).to.be.equal(0)
          })
```

### Mitigation

 A possible mitigation is to convert the USDC rewards to an 18-decimal value when computing for `rate`. When claiming rewards, convert the earned USDC rewards back to 6-decimal precision if needed.
