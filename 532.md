# Users can invoke `notifyRewardAmount()` with a dust reward amount to reduce the reward rate.

### Summary

Users can repeatedly call `notifyRewardAmount()` with dust reward amount, which can drastically reduce the reward generation rate, thereby affecting the rate at which other users receive their rewards.

### Root Cause

Users can add whitelisted reward tokens via the `notifyRewardAmount()` function. After updating rewards states and token verifying, the `_addRewardsForToken()` function (`SymmStaking.sol:289`) is then invoked to recalculate the reward rate for each token.
```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
276:	_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
289:			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

If the reward period is still active, any leftover rewards (from the remaining time) are added to the new rewards. The combined amount is then used to set a new reward rate (`SymmStaking.sol:374`) and start a new reward period, which has the same duration as the previous one (`SymmStaking.sol:378`). As shown in `SymmStaking.sol:374`, if the added `amount` is dust, then the resulting new `state.rate` will be smaller than before.
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
374:			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

    		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
378:    	state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

The functions `notifyRewardAmount()` and `_addRewardsForToken()` impose no restrictions on the caller nor on the amount of reward that can be added. Therefore, a malicious user could repeatedly invoke the `notifyRewardAmount` function with dust reward amount to continuously reducing the reward rate. This will affect the speed at which other users receive their rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reward period is still active, i.e. `block.timestamp < state.periodFinish`.


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_


### Attack Path

1. Manager adds a whitelist reward token `T` through `configureRewardToken()`. The reward duration is `1 weeks` by default.
2. Symmio supplies `N * 10**decimals()` rewards token `T`. These tokens are expected to be distributed in `1 weeks`.
3. Half a week has passed, and a malicious user calls the `notifyRewardAmount()` function to add another `1` reward token. Since the added amount is negligible, the new reward rate will be reduced to half of the previous rate.
4. After another week passes, all the rewards have been distributed.
5. As a result, the malicious user extends the reward distribution period from `1 week` to `1.5 weeks` without increasing the total reward amount (`1` can be ignored). Moreover, the malicious user can repeat this process, further reducing the reward rate.

### Impact

Malicious user can reduce the reward rate without increasing the total reward amount, this will affect the speed at which other users receive their rewards.

### PoC

_No response_


### Mitigation

Restrict the caller of `notifyRewardAmount()` to specific roles, or set a minimum reward amount to be added.
