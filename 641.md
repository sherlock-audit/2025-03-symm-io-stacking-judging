# [M-02] Paused State Bypass for `resetAmount` allows users to re-vest their tokens while contract is expected to be paused.

### Summary

The function `resetAmount` in `SymmVesting.sol` does not enforce the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing **any user (privileged or unprivileged)** to reset their vesting plan even when the contract is paused. This could lead to modifications to token vesting schedules while interactions are expected to be frozen.


### Root Cause

Function `resetAmount` does not have `whenNotPaused` modifier

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/libraries/LibVestingPlan.sol#L71

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **The contract's `paused` variable must be `true`**, indicating that interactions should be disabled.
2. **The function `resetAmount` must lack the `whenNotPaused` modifier**, allowing execution despite the contract being paused.
3. **Any user (privileged or unprivileged) can call `resetAmount`** to modify their **vesting plan** while the `SymmVesting` contract is paused.
4. **The vesting plan must be active and have a remaining duration**.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **The contract must have been paused** by an admin or governance action.
2. **User must have an active vesting plan**.
3. **User must have claimed all of their vesting rewards prior to now.**

### Attack Path

1. **User** calls `resetAmount(self, amount)` in `SymmVesting`, modifying their vesting plan while the contract is paused.
2. **The vesting plan extends the duration**, altering the locked token schedule.
3. **The intended freeze on financial interactions is bypassed**, potentially affecting accounting and token distribution.
4. **The pause mechanism fails to prevent vesting modifications**

### Impact

- **Users can modify their vesting schedules** while the contract is paused, potentially altering locked token allocations in unintended ways.
- **This could affect protocol accounting**, as users may re-vest tokens at an unexpected time, interfering with financial calculations.
- **The pause mechanism loses effectiveness**, as a critical financial function remains operational.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add modifier `whenNotPaused` to function `resetAmount`

```solidity
function resetAmount(VestingPlan storage self, uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused returns (VestingPlan storage) {
    // Function logic
}
```
