# Users can prevent admin from being able to unwhitelist reward token

### Summary

The trustless reward notification process and the requirement that all users must claim rewards before a token can be unwhitelisted allow users to prevent the admin from unwhitelisting reward tokens. This occurs because users can either continue notifying rewards to keep pendingRewards > 10 or choose not to claim rewards, ensuring pendingRewards does not decrease. As a result, the protocol may become unable to unwhitelist tokens, potentially clogging the rewardTokens storage.

currently to fix this , the protocol would have to pause the entire contract for a duration of at about one week and then claim all users rewards for them, this is extremely inefficient and not cost effective as there could be thousands of staking addresses, also the contract would have to remain paused until it is complete to prevent users from notifying more tokens 

### Root Cause

The choice to require all users to claim rewards before unwhitelisting a token is a mistake, as it creates a dependency on user behavior and allows malicious actors to disrupt the protocol's functionality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

A user notifies a small reward amount to keep pendingRewards > 10.

The admin attempts to unwhitelist the reward token but fails because pendingRewards > 10.

Alternatively, users choose not to claim rewards, ensuring pendingRewards does not decrease.

The protocol becomes unable to unwhitelist the token, potentially clogging the rewardTokens storage.

### Impact

protocol would be unable to unwhitelist a tokens potentially clogging rewardTokens storage 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

create a specific pause state more every token to pause reward notifications for that token without pausing the entire contract 
the protocol can them progressively claim all user tokens for them over a period of time
