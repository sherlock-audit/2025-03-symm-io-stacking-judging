# Reward Calculation Precision Bug Due to Integer Division

### Summary

The use of integer division in calculating the reward rate will cause inaccurate reward accrual for stakers


### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:_addRewardsForToken] the reward rate is calculated using the expression `state.rate = amount / state.duration;`

For example, if the admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1000 tokens for a 7-day period, the computed daily reward rate becomes `1000 / 7` tokens, truncating any fractional remainder. This causes stakers to receive slightly less reward than intended each day.
1000/7 = 142.85 
0.85 tokens are lost each day.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a reward amount (e.g., 1000 tokens) that is not a multiple of the reward duration (e.g., 7 days).  
2. The calculation does not incorporate any scaling factor or fixed-point arithmetic to retain the fractional part of the division.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Stakers expect a precise daily reward accrual based on the announced reward amount.  
2. The staking system relies on accurate reward computations for fair distribution among users.


### Attack Path

1.The admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a reward amount of 1000 tokens for a 7-day period.  
2. The function `_addRewardsForToken` computes the daily reward rate as `1000 / 7`, which, due to integer division, truncates any fractional tokens.  
3. As a result, each day stakers receive a truncated reward amount, leading to an overall lower reward distribution over the full period.

### Impact

Stakers receive lower than expected rewards over the duration of the reward period, potentially eroding trust in the staking mechanism and causing user dissatisfaction due to the loss of fractional rewards.
