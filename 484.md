# Blacklisted address can make reward tokens (i.e USDC / USDT) unable to be removed from the reward tokens whitelist on the SymmStaking contract

### Summary

Tokens that are used as reward tokens can be managed by entering the token address into the whitelist, so that only tokens that are in the whitelist can be used as reward tokens. This also applies vice versa, tokens that are no longer supported as reward tokens can be removed from the whitelist. Both of these operations can be executed with the `configureRewardToken()` function.

The main problem here is that the reward tokens in this audit scope are `USDC` and `USDT`, both of which have a blacklisted feature and there is also a check if pending rewards > 10 then the token cannot be removed from the whitelist so that if the `claimFor()` function is called by `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to force the reward to the blacklisted address, it will be in vain because the tx will revert and end up `USDC` / `USDT` cannot be removed from the whitelist reward tokens.

**NOTE**

This issue may affect another reward tokens because the threshold for pending reward is to low, its 10 (dust amount) .

### Root Cause

*In [SymmStaking.sol:320](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) there is a check for the minimum pending reward token before removing it from the whitelist*

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor call `deposit()` with blacklisted address as receiver
2. Assume pending reward > 10 token
3. For some reason, `USDC` / `USDT` will be removed from the reward tokens whitelist
4. For decreasing pending reward, `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` call `claimFor()` and pass blacklisted address. This tx will end up as revert because the behavior of blacklisted address.
5. Because pending reward > 10 then USDC / USDT cant remove from whitelist reward tokens

### Impact

USDC / USDT canâ€™t be remove from whitelist reward tokens.

This break core functionality that is managing reward tokens in the staking contract.
