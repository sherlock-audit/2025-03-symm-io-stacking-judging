# AMM frontrunning will cause losses due to missing deadline parameter in liquidity addition

### Summary

The lack of deadline parameters in liquidity operations will cause financial loss for SymmVesting users as MEV searchers can frontrun and sandwich their transactions to extract value, especially in volatile market conditions.

### Root Cause

In [SymmVesting.sol:185-188](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L185-L188) there are multiple issues with how token approvals are handled for liquidity provision:

```solidity
usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```

1. The approvals to PERMIT2 use `block.timestamp` as the expiry with no buffer, making these approvals expire immediately
2. There's no deadline parameter for the transaction execution itself, allowing transactions to be pending indefinitely
3. No minimum output amount guarantees beyond a default 1% slippage protection:
   ```solidity
   uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
   ```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to have tokens locked in a SYMM vesting plan
2. The user calls `addLiquidity()` or `addLiquidityByPercentage()`


### External Pre-conditions

1. Network congestion causing transaction delays
2. Volatile market conditions for SYMM/USDC pair

### Attack Path

1. User calculates expected LP tokens using `getLiquidityQuote()`
2. User submits transaction to add liquidity with 1% default slippage
3. MEV searcher sees the pending transaction in the mempool
4. Searcher manipulates the pool ratio by executing a large swap before the user's transaction
5. User's transaction executes with 1% slippage, receiving significantly fewer LP tokens
6. Searcher reverts the pool ratio with another transaction, extracting value from the user

### Impact

The users suffer financial losses as they receive fewer LP tokens than they should. In volatile markets, the 1% default slippage might be insufficient protection. Additionally, without a deadline parameter, transactions can remain pending during high gas prices and execute much later under unfavorable conditions, causing even greater losses.

### PoC

Add this test case into file: `token/tests/symmVesting.behavior.ts`

```typescipt

	it('VULNERABILITY: No deadline protection enables sandwich attacks', async () => {
		// Setup - Get the pool contract instance
		const poolAddress = await symmVesting.POOL();
		const poolContract = await ethers.getContractAt("ERC20", poolAddress);
		
		// Get initial quote
		const symmAmount = e(100);
		const initialQuote = await symmVesting.getLiquidityQuote(symmAmount);
		const expectedLpAmount = initialQuote.lpAmount;
		
		// Store the user's LP balance before adding liquidity
		const lpBalanceBefore = await poolContract.balanceOf(await user1.getAddress());
		
		// User's transaction executes with default 1% slippage
		await symmVesting.connect(user1).addLiquidity(symmAmount, 0, e(1000));
		
		// Add after first liquidity addition:
		console.log("Simulating transaction delay (e.g., during network congestion)");
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [86400]); // 1 day later
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", []);
		console.log("Transaction still executes without deadline check");
		
		// Check received LP tokens
		const lpBalanceAfter = await poolContract.balanceOf(await user1.getAddress());
		const actualLpReceived = lpBalanceAfter - lpBalanceBefore;
		
		console.log(`Expected LP amount: ${expectedLpAmount}`);
		console.log(`Actual LP received: ${actualLpReceived}`);
		console.log(`In a sandwich attack, the received amount would be less but within 1% slippage`);
		
		// VULNERABILITY PROOF: No deadline parameter means transactions can be executed at any time
		// Even if this transaction is pending for hours/days during volatile market conditions,
		// it will still execute as long as the final LP amount is within 1% slippage
		
		// Demonstrate that with proper slippage protection but no deadline, the attack would fail only
		// if slippage exceeds tolerance (but timing attacks would still work)
		await expect(
		  symmVesting.connect(user2).addLiquidity(
			symmAmount, 
			expectedLpAmount, // Exact amount expected, no slippage
			e(1000)
		  )
		).to.be.reverted; // Would revert due to slippage protection
	});
```

### Mitigation

1. Add a deadline parameter to liquidity functions:
```solidity
function addLiquidity(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minLpAmount,
    uint256 maxUsdcIn,
    uint256 deadline
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
    return _addLiquidityProcess(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn);
}
```

2. Add buffer time to PERMIT2 approvals:
```solidity
uint256 expiry = block.timestamp + 15 minutes;
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(expiry));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(expiry));
```

3. Improve default slippage protection or require users to specify slippage:
```solidity
require(minLpAmount > 0, "Must specify minimum LP amount");
```
