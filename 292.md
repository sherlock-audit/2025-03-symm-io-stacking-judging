# configureRewardToken() can't remove token if user with pending rewards gets blacklisted

## Description
We have inside `configureRewardToken()` the [following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) while removing a reward token:
```solidity
    if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

This can result in:
1. Alice has some pending rewards in USDC which is greater than 10.
2. Alice gets blacklisted by USDC before she can claim her rewards. Now neither `claimRewards()` nor `claimFor()` can be called successfully.
3. Now `configureRewardToken(address(USDC), false)` can't be called as it would revert.

## Impact
Reward tokens which have a blacklist functionality can enter a state where they can't be removed.

## Mitigation 
We already have a `rescueTokens()` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343) which can be modified:
```diff
-       function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+       function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver, bool updatePendingRewards) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
+           if (updatePendingRewards) pendingRewards[token] = pendingRewards[token] - (pendingRewards[token] > amount? amount : pendingRewards[token]);
            emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
        }
```
Now the admin can first call `rescueTokens(address(USDC), blackListedUserPendingRewardAmount, rescueAddress, true)` and then proceed with `configureRewardToken(address(USDC), false)`.
