# Wrong calculations in earned function

### Summary

Calculation in `earned` function is calculated the wrong way.  `(rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken]))` is done before multiplying to `(balanceOf[account]`. This is wrong

### Root Cause

 ` userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken]))` is first deducted from (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken)  before multiplying by `(balanceOf[account]`. This is wrong 

### Internal Pre-conditions

 `(rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken]))` is done before multiplying to `(balanceOf[account]`. This is wrong 

### External Pre-conditions

 `(rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken]))` is done before multiplying to `(balanceOf[account]`. This is wrong 

### Attack Path

1.  users get lesser rewards than they should based on this wrong calculations 

### Impact

It will result in wrong calculations for stakers and also likely to lead in a reduction of reward calculations for stakers 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 The `balanceOf[account` should first be multiplied by `rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken)` before subtracting userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]. Do this by removing the brackets so that User's balance can be multiplied by rewardPerToken before deducting userRewardPerTokenPaid
    
      function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
	         	return
			      (balanceOf[account] * rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] 
       [_rewardsToken]) / 1e18) +
			       rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
	       }
