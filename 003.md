# Potential precision loss in the calculation of the reward rate

### Summary

The reward rate always rounds down which means that it will be lower than it should be and some amount of rewards will be left undistributed. Even though these rewards can be rescued by the admin, this causes a loss of funds for the stakers since the rewards should be distributed before.

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:370](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370) and [SymmStaking.sol:374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374) the rate potentially rounds down and causes the rate to be lower than it should be.

The rate is calculated in the following way:
```solidity
rate = amount / state.duration
or
rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration
```

Since the `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` is equal to 1 week (604800 seconds), let's continue with this value.
Let's assume the `amount` equals `6044000`:
```solidity
rate = 6044000 / 604800 = 9.99338624339
```

This rounds down to 9. As a result, 0.99338624339 will be lost per second.
For one full period, this equals a loss of around 600800:
```solidity
0.99338624339 * 604800 = 600800.000002
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits by calling `SymmStaking::deposit()`.
2. `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` is called. The calculated rate rounds down.
3. After the period ends, Alice withdraws. As a result, she earned less than the should have due to the rounded down reward rate. 

### Impact

Stakers will lose out on a portion of the rewards. The rate could even round down to zero which means that there will be no rewards distributed whatsoever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding some sort of scaling factor to the calculation of the reward rate.
