# Setter role will allow unlimited token claims by the same user

### Summary

The lack of claiming history validation will cause an economic vulnerability for the SymmAllocationClaimer protocol as a compromised setter or malicious user with setter role will reset allocations for users who have already claimed, allowing them to claim multiple times.

### Root Cause

In [SymmAllocationClaimer.sol:90-106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/claimSymm/SymmAllocationClaimer.sol#L90-L106) the `setBatchAllocations` function updates user allocations without checking if they've already claimed tokens. This allows resetting allocations for users who have already claimed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

  1. A user needs to have an allocation set by a setter
  2. The user needs to claim their allocation
  3. A setter needs to call `setBatchAllocations` for the same user, setting a new allocation value

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

  1. Setter calls `setBatchAllocations` to set an allocation for User1
  2. User1 calls `claim()` to claim their allocation
  3. Setter calls `setBatchAllocations` again for User1, updating their allocation to a new value
  4. User1 calls `claim()` again to claim the new allocation
  5. Steps 3-4 can be repeated indefinitely


### Impact

The protocol suffers an unauthorized token distribution beyond intended allocations. The system could reach the `MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN` limit (400,000,000 tokens) in a way that favors specific users who can claim multiple times, leading to an unfair distribution model. Malicious users with setter privileges could claim far more tokens than intended for their addresses.

### PoC

Add the test into file: `token/tests/SymmAllocationClaimer.vulnerability.ts`

```solidity
  it("VULNERABILITY: Allows users to claim multiple times when allocations are reset", async () => {
    // Initial setup - Set allocations for a user
    const users = [context.signers.user1.address]
    const allocations = [e(1000)]
    await symmClaim.connect(context.signers.setter).setBatchAllocations(users, allocations)
    
    // User claims their allocation
    await symmClaim.connect(context.signers.user1).claim()
    
    // Check balances after first claim
    let user1Balance = await symmToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1.address)
    expect(user1Balance).to.equal(e(500)) // 50% of 1000 (based on mintFactor)
    expect(await symmClaim.adminClaimableAmount()).to.equal(e(500)) 
    expect(await symmClaim.userAllocations(context.signers.user1.address)).to.equal(e(0))
    
    // Setter updates allocation for the same user
    const newAllocations = [e(2000)]
    await symmClaim.connect(context.signers.setter).setBatchAllocations(users, newAllocations)
    
    // Verify allocation is updated
    expect(await symmClaim.userAllocations(context.signers.user1.address)).to.equal(e(2000))
    
    // User can claim again with new allocation
    await symmClaim.connect(context.signers.user1).claim()
    
    // Check balances after second claim
    user1Balance = await symmToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1.address)
    expect(user1Balance).to.equal(e(1500)) // 500 (first claim) + 1000 (second claim)
    expect(await symmClaim.adminClaimableAmount()).to.equal(e(1500)) // 500 (first claim) + 1000 (second claim)
    
    // User's claimedAmounts should reflect all claims
    expect(await symmClaim.userClaimedAmounts(context.signers.user1.address)).to.equal(e(1500))
  })
```

```bash
npx hardhat test --grep "VULNERABILITY: Allows users to claim multiple times when allocations are reset"

### Mitigation


To fix this vulnerability, implement a check in the `setBatchAllocations` function to verify if a user has already claimed tokens:

```solidity
function setBatchAllocations(address[] calldata users, uint256[] calldata allocations) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    if (users.length != allocations.length) revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
    if (users.length == 0) revert EmptyArrays();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        if (users[i] == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        // Add check to prevent re-allocation for users who have already claimed
        if (userClaimedAmounts[users[i]] > 0) continue; // Skip users who have already claimed
        
        // Subtract old allocation from total
        totalAllocation = totalAllocation - userAllocations[users[i]];
        // Set new allocation
        userAllocations[users[i]] = allocations[i];
        // Add new allocation to total
        totalAllocation = totalAllocation + allocations[i];
    }
    if (totalAllocation > MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN) {
        revert TotalAllocationExceedsMax(totalAllocation, MAX_ISSUABLE_TOKEN);
    }
    emit BatchAllocationsSet(users, allocations);
}
```
