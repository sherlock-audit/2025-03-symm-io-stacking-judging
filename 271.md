# Dust `SymmStaking::pendingRewards` will prevent `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` from disabling reward tokens

### Summary

[SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) reverts if there are more than 10 `pendingRewards[token]`, which is always going to happen due to rounding errors when notifying rewards amount. Thus, rewards can never be disabled.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking:320`, dust amounts over 10 will always be present.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount()` adds the full reward amount to `pendingRewards[token]`, but the rate has precision loss over the duration, such that pending rewards never becomes 0.
2. `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` will never succeed in disabling a reward token because of  `pendingRewards[token] > 10`.

### Impact

DoSed `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken()` to disabled a reward token, which is key functionality as it could compromise the other rewards and would render the contract useless. For example, if one of the reward tokens was to revert every time rewards are transferred maliciously, all funds would be stuck.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Simply disable the token and withdraw the funds if necessary.
