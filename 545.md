# Issue with Reward Rate Calculation for Tokens with Few Decimals


#### **Summary:**  
The current implementation of the reward rate calculation in the staking contract faces a precision loss issue when dealing with tokens that have fewer decimals (e.g., tokens with only 2 decimals). Specifically, if the token's amount is significantly smaller relative to the staking duration (1 week = 604,800 seconds), the calculated reward rate becomes truncated to `0`. This issue arises because Solidity performs integer division, and the result of the division is truncated when the decimal part is lost, as mentioned in docs contract will have mupliple tokens as rewards as they get deployed to multiple chain then tokens with fewer decimals can result in not being able to rewards to stakers.

#### **Root Cause:**  
- **Precision Loss due to Integer Division**:  
  Solidity performs **integer division**, meaning any decimal or fractional value resulting from division is discarded. This becomes a problem when dividing small token amounts (especially those with fewer decimals) by large values like the staking duration (604,800 seconds for 1 week).  
  - For example, with a token amount of 200,000 (with 2 decimals) and a duration of 604,800 seconds, the reward rate becomes a small floating point value that gets truncated to `0` during integer division.

#### **Impact:**  
- **No Reward Issued**: When the reward rate is truncated to `0`, stakers will receive **no rewards**, even though they should be entitled to receive rewards over time based on the amount of tokens staked.

#### **Attack Path:**

#### **Example Calculation:**  
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the issue:

- **Token Amount**: `200,000` (i.e., 200e3) of a token with 2 decimals.
- **Token Decimals**: `2` (smallest unit = `0.01`).
- **Duration**: `604,800` seconds (1 week).
  
The reward rate (`state.rate`) calculation:

1. **Amount in units**: The actual amount, with 2 decimals, is `200,000 * 10^2 = 20,000,000` in full units.
   
2. **Rate Calculation**:  
   ```solidity
   state.rate = amount / state.duration;
   state.rate = 200,000 / 604,800 = 0.3305785123966942 (floating point)
   ```
   However, Solidity truncates the decimal part, so the rate becomes `0`.

3. **Result**: Due to truncation, the reward rate ends up being `0`, and users receive no rewards.

#### **Mitigation:**
- **Solution 1: Implement Precision Handling**:  
  To prevent the truncation issue, we need to multiply the amount by a **precision factor** (e.g., `1e18`) before performing the division. This ensures that the division retains its precision and does not result in a reward rate of `0`.

  Example modification:
  ```solidity
  uint256 precisionFactor = 1e18; // To preserve precision

  if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
      state.rate = (amount * precisionFactor) / state.duration;
  } else {
      uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
      uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
      state.rate = ((amount + leftover) * precisionFactor) / state.duration;
  }
  ```
