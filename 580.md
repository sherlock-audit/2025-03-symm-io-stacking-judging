# USDC blacklist can DoS the token whitelist functionality

### Summary

This happens because of USDC blacklist in the following line of code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385-L400

```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
@>				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```
The issue here is not that the user is not going to receive his rewards but actually that the `pendingRewards` mapping won't be able to go under 10, which will DoS the protocol's whitelist removal functionality for every token

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is the following line of code in the `SymmStaking::_claimRewardsFor` function:
```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
@>				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

User withdrawing his rewards or owner withdrawing them for him

### External Pre-conditions

User being blacklisted by USDC

### Attack Path

1.User deposits his `SYMM` tokens in the staking contract.
2. User getting blacklisted by USDC
3. Thats all that it's needed. From then on the accumulated rewards for the user can't be removed from the `pendingRewards` mapping, leading to token whitelist/blacklist mechanism DoS

### Impact

Protocol whitelist/blacklist mechanism DoS

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Transfer the funds to third party contract from where a user can claim
