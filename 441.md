# User will bypass LP vesting lockup as expired SYMM vesting will set LP endTime to the past

## Summary:
When adding liquidity, the LP vesting plan is initialized using the SYMM vesting plan’s endTime. If the SYMM vesting plan has already expired, the LP vesting plan’s endTime is set in the past, allowing LP tokens to vest immediately rather than remaining locked.

## Root Cause:
In SymmVesting.sol:_addLiquidityProcess, the LP vesting plan is set up with:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L158

```solidity
			_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, symmVestingPlan.endTime, users, amounts);
```
If `symmVestingPlan.endTime < block.timestamp`, the LP vesting plan is effectively unlocked immediately.

## Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The caller’s SYMM vesting plan has an `endTime` in the past.

## External Pre-conditions:
None.

## Attack Path:
1. A user calls `addLiquidity()` after their SYMM vesting plan has expired.
2. The LP vesting plan is created with an expired `endTime`.
3. LP tokens vest instantly, bypassing the intended lockup period.

## Impact:
Users may unlock LP tokens earlier than intended, undermining the vesting schedule and potentially allowing premature liquidation or sale of LP tokens.

## PoC 
This PoC simulates a scenario where the SYMM vesting plan is expired. It then checks that the LP vesting plan’s `endTime` is set in the past, resulting in immediate vesting.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { SymmVesting } from "../typechain-types";

describe("SymmVesting - Immediate LP Vesting", function () {
  let vesting: SymmVesting;
  let user: any;
  const expiredEndTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 3600; // 1 hour ago

  before(async function () {
    [user] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const VestingFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SymmVesting", user);
    vesting = (await VestingFactory.deploy()) as SymmVesting;
    await vesting.deployed();
    // For PoC: Set up a SYMM vesting plan for the user with endTime = expiredEndTime.
    // This setup might be done via a test helper or direct state manipulation.
  });

  it("should result in immediate LP vesting if SYMM vesting plan is expired", async function () {
    // Call addLiquidity() (or a helper function) such that the LP vesting plan is created.
    // Assume a view function getLPVestingEndTime exists (for testing) that returns the LP vesting endTime for the user.
    const lpEndTime = await vesting.getLPVestingEndTime(user.address); // Hypothetical function for testing
    // The LP vesting endTime should be less than or equal to the current block timestamp.
    expect(lpEndTime).to.be.lte(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000));
  });
});
```
**PoC Explanation:**
- The Bug:
The LP vesting plan is set using the SYMM vesting plan’s `endTime` without checking if it is in the future.

- How It Works:
If the SYMM vesting plan has already expired, the LP vesting plan's `endTime` becomes a past timestamp. Consequently, LP tokens vest immediately upon creation.

- Attack Scenario:
A user with an expired SYMM vesting plan calls `addLiquidity()` and inadvertently receives LP tokens that vest immediately, bypassing the intended lockup period.

## Mitigation:
When initializing the LP vesting plan, use:

```solidity
uint256 lpEndTime = symmVestingPlan.endTime < block.timestamp ? block.timestamp : symmVestingPlan.endTime;
_setupVestingPlans(SYMM_LP, block.timestamp, lpEndTime, users, amounts);
```
