# Anyone can prolong stake duration to infinity making rates smaller

### Summary

Notify reward amount allows anyone to notify about reward amounts providing any quantity of tokens. 
This leads to extending stake duration for the full duration of time and updating staking rates making them smaller.

### Root Cause

Because anyone can provide rewards and notify about them, user can notify about reward of only 1 wei to grief staking participants, so that they get their rewards later. Notifying about 1 wei of whitelisted token  extends the staking by the full `state.duration`. New rates are calculated by dividing `left overs` + `newRewards` (which can be only 1 wei of token)  by full state.duration. End time of staking is updated by `block.timestamp` + `state.duration`
This process can be repeated multiple times, effectively extending the end time of the stake, making it impossible to receive the full amount of prizes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin configures some reward token
2. Admin supplies some rewards to Staking contract
3. Users participate in staking
4. Attacker has to have atleast 1 wei of whitelisted token by admin

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.  Attacker approves Symm Staking contract for i.e 1 wei of whitelisted token they wish to supply
2.  Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` providing whitelisted token and 1 wei as an amount.
3. Period finish of distributing rewards is exceeded by full duration (7 days) making rates smaller 

Attacker can repeat this process over and over.

### Impact

Users receive smaller amount of rewards than aticipated in a lot longer amount of time, without receiving any meaningfull additional rewards.
This griefing attack makes it almost impossible to reach full distribution of rewards, due to the fact that anyone can extend the `periodFinish` by the `duration` providing small amout of tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict acces to `notifyRewardAmount` to only Admin.
