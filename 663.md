# Redundant Check in `function _resetVestingPlans` Preventing Liquidity Addition in Balancer pool

### Summary

In scenarios where more than half of the initially locked tokens have been unlocked, users are unable to reset their vesting plans of the remaining locked amount due to a redundant check  `if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis()` . This issue prevents users from effectively adding liquidity to platforms like Balancer, as they cannot adjust their vesting plans of the remaining locked token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has a vesting plan with tokens that are partially unlocked. but with most of the initial token amount unlocked.
The contract logic includes a check that restricts resetting the vesting amount to below the unlocked amount

### External Pre-conditions

The user intends to add liquidity to a platform like Balancer , requiring them to adjust their vesting plan to reflect only the remaining locked tokens.
The user attempts to reset the vesting plan to an amount less than the unlocked tokens.

### Attack Path

- user intends to add liquidity to a platform like Balancer, requiring them to adjust their vesting plan to reflect only the remaining locked tokens.

- The `function _resetVestingPlans` is called to reset vesting plans

- The redundant check prevents this adjustment, causing the transaction to revert.


### Impact

User will be unable to add liquidity to balancer pool in edge case

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove redundant check
