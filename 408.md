# Attacker can prevent stakers from claiming all rewards by extending reward period

### Summary

In the `_addRewardsForToken` function, the `periodFinish` is reset to `block.timestamp + state.duration` each time rewards are added. This allows an attacker to extend the reward period by adding dust amount, effectively preventing stakers from claiming all their rewards.

### Root Cause

- [`_addRewardsForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) updates `periodFinish` every time it is called, even if the previous reward period is still active.  
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
@>		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
- A malicious actor can call `notifyRewardAmount` with tiny amounts (dust) to extend the reward period indefinitely.
- If the attacker's reward had not been added, stakers would have been able to claim all rewards at the previous `periodFinish`, but after the attacker's reward has been added, they would only be able to claim a smaller reward at the same time.

### Attack Path

1. Initial reward is added at `time0`:
reward amount = 1000e6 (for simplicity there is only one staker)
reward duration = 1 week
reward end time = 1 week after time0
2. After 0.5 week, attacker adds dust reward:
reward duration = 1 week. 
new reward end time = 1.5 week after time0.
Reward for first 0.5 week is 1000e6 / 2= 500e6.
Due to new malicious addReward, 500e6 will be distributed during new 1 week.
3. Staker can claim only 750e6 after 1 week from `time0`:
500e6 + 500e6 / 2 = 750e6.
If there is no malicious addReward, staker can claims 1000e6 after 1 week from `time0`.

**If the attacker repeats malicious reward addition, stakers' reward claim is further delayed.**

### Impact

Stakers have to wait a long time to claim all rewards due to the attacker's reward addition. In other words, stakers' reward claim is delayed due to the attacker's reward addition.

### Mitigation

To ensure that the reward period only extends after each complete period:
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
++			state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
--			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
++			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / remaining;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
--		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
