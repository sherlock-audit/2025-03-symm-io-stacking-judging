# SYMM Token Minting Will Dilute Staking Rewards

### Summary

The minting of SYMM tokens in the vesting contract will cause a dilution of staking rewards for stakers as the contract will mint additional SYMM tokens to cover vesting claims, increasing the total supply and potentially devaluing SYMM-based rewards.



### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol, the _mintTokenIfPossible function allows the contract to mint SYMM tokens when its balance is insufficient to fulfill a vesting claim:
solidity
```solidity
function _mintTokenIfPossible(address token, uint256 amount) internal override {
    if (token == SYMM) IMintableERC20(token).mint(address(this), amount);
}
```

This minting mechanism, while designed to ensure sufficient SYMM for claims, increases the total SYMM supply. If SYMM is used as a reward token in the SymmStaking contract, this inflation could dilute the value of staking rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to whitelist SYMM as a reward token in SymmStaking: Currently, rewards are stablecoins, but an admin with the REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE must add SYMM to the reward token list for this vulnerability to manifest.

2. Vesting contract’s SYMM balance needs to be less than the claimable amount: The minting is triggered only when the contract lacks sufficient SYMM to cover a user’s claim.

3. Users need to claim vested SYMM tokens: The minting occurs when users call the vesting contract to claim their tokens, prompting the balance check and potential minting.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This vulnerability is not a traditional exploit but a systemic issue that devalues staking rewards over time. The path unfolds as follows:
1. Admin calls a function to add SYMM as a reward token in SymmStaking: An admin with REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE whitelists SYMM, enabling SYMM-based staking rewards.

2. Users call the vesting contract to claim SYMM tokens: Users request their vested SYMM from SymmVesting.sol.

3. Vesting contract mints SYMM if its balance is insufficient: If the contract’s SYMM balance is too low, _mintTokenIfPossible mints additional SYMM to cover the claim.

4. Total SYMM supply increases: The newly minted SYMM inflates the circulating supply, diluting the value of SYMM-based staking rewards.



### Impact

The stakers suffer an approximate loss proportional to the increase in SYMM supply. As the total SYMM supply grows due to vesting claims, the value of each SYMM token decreases, reducing the real value of staking rewards. This dilution could significantly affect stakers’ returns and the long-term attractiveness of the staking system.

Severity
Likelihood: Medium – Depends on SYMM being added as a reward token and frequent minting due to low vesting contract balances.

Impact: High – Dilution could substantially devalue SYMM-based rewards, impacting all stakers and potentially eroding trust in the protocol.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent SYMM as a Reward Token:
Explicitly restrict SYMM from being added to the SymmStaking reward token whitelist if it’s not intended for staking rewards.
