# lack of input validation allows `function _setupVestingPlans` to be called multiple times

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L133-L141

### Summary

The `function setupVestingPlans` in the `Vesting.sol` contract is designed to initialize vesting plans for multiple users. This function is restricted so that only an account with the `SETTER_ROLE` can call it. Internally, it delegates its work to a helper function called `_setupVestingPlans`, which is also used by the SymmVesting contract. This helper function leverages `LibVestingPlan` to configure the vesting plans—but only when the amount field in the provided VestingPlanOps structure is zero, meaning that no vesting plan has been previously set.

However, if the amount is zero, the setup function can be called repeatedly without any restrictions.

### Root Cause

There is no validation or check in the _setupVestingPlans function to verify that the provided liquidity amount is greater than zero. This lack of validation opens up an unintended attack vector.

### Internal Pre-condition:

1. The `ROUTER` must allow adding zero liquidity as a valid operation in `SymmVesting.sol`

### External Pre-condition:

1. The attacker’s vesting plan for the SYMM token is already configured in the system.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker first calls the setupVestingPlans (via _setupVestingPlans) with an amount of zero. Since the contract logic only checks that the amount is zero (indicating an unset plan), this call is accepted.

2. The attacker then waits until rewards are distributed.

3. After rewards are sent, the attacker calls the function again with a non-zero amount. This call overrides the previously set vesting plan.

4. The attacker then claims the rewards, effectively capturing rewards that rightfully belong to other users.

### Impact

Through this sequence of operations, an attacker can capture rewards that should have been distributed to other participants, effectively stealing their rightful rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this vulnerability, a validation check should be added in the _setupVestingPlans function to ensure that the amount provided is strictly greater than zero before allowing a vesting plan to be set up or overwritten.
