# getLiquidityQuote()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247
Looking at the overall logic and standard practices, **the most suspicious and problematic place is the `getLiquidityQuote()` function**, specifically this line:

```solidity
usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
```

Let's briefly interpret its meaning:

```solidity
usdcAmount = (usdcAmount * 1e18) / 1e30 (rounded up)
           = usdcAmount / 1e12
```

In other words, the originally calculated `usdcAmount` is unnecessarily divided again by \(10^{12}\). For a typical pairing of USDC (6 decimals) and SYMM (assuming 18 decimals), this extra step doesn't align with the commonly used logic for calculating token quantities based on pool ratios. This would very likely cause the resulting `usdcAmount` to be significantly smaller than intended, creating an unintended "scaling error."

---

## Why does this issue occur?

- **Common Pool Ratio Formula**  
  For a pool with two tokens (`tokenA`, `tokenB`), if you want to add `x` units of `tokenA` without altering the pool’s current ratio, the required amount of `tokenB` typically is:
  \[
    \text{tokenB\_in} = x \times \frac{\text{balanceB}}{\text{balanceA}}
  \]
  In your code, this corresponds to:
  ```solidity
  usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
  ```
  Up to this point, the calculation is standard and correct.

- **Redundant Scaling (`_mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30)`)**  
  The line:
  ```solidity
  usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
  ```
  adds an unnecessary additional division by \(10^{12}\). Regardless of whether your intention was decimal alignment or a particular rounding-up approach, this step looks suspicious. Standard practices never include an extra division by \(10^{12}\) at this stage.

If your intent was indeed to perform some specific precision conversion, you must clearly justify why dividing by \(10^{12}\) is needed. Currently, the context provides no comment explaining such scaling. Thus, it strongly suggests this is a logical bug.

## Possible fixes

1. **Most direct fix:**  
   Simply remove the suspicious line `_mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30)`:
   ```solidity
   usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
   // Remove mulDivUp entirely
   ```

2. **If precision handling is genuinely necessary:**  
   - Clarify decimals for both USDC and SYMM tokens explicitly.
   - Typically, if SYMM has 18 decimals and USDC has 6 decimals, and if `POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances()` returns balances consistent with each token's decimals, then your proportion calculation already implicitly handles decimals correctly using integer arithmetic—there is no need for further scaling.
   - If you insist on internally standardizing all token calculations to 18 decimals, you must verify carefully that you haven't already scaled these amounts elsewhere in your code. Double scaling always leads to incorrect results.
