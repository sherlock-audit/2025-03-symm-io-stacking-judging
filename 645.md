# Attacker will exploit transient stakes to claim inflated rewards from stakers

### Summary

The lack of synchronization between token withdrawals in SymmStaking and liquidity additions in SymmVesting will cause inflated reward claims for attackers as they will exploit transient stakes to manipulate reward calculations.



### Root Cause

The choice to allow immediate use of withdrawn tokens from SymmStaking in SymmVesting's addLiquidity function without validating the staking state is a mistake, as it enables attackers to exploit the timing discrepancy between reward updates and token movements. Specifically:
- In SymmStaking.sol, the withdraw function transfers SYMM tokens to the specified address (e.g., SymmVesting) without updating reward states synchronously.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(msg.sender);

		if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
		if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (amount > balanceOf[msg.sender]) revert InsufficientBalance(balanceOf[msg.sender], amount);
		IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(to, amount);
		totalSupply -= amount;
		balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount, to);
	}
```

- In SymmVesting.sol, the _addLiquidityProcess function does not check whether the tokens being used were recently withdrawn from SymmStaking, allowing manipulation of transient stakes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to stake a large amount of SYMM tokens in SymmStaking to set the staking balance high enough to influence reward calculations significantly.

2. Attacker needs to withdraw the staked SYMM tokens immediately after staking to transfer them to SymmVesting before the reward state is updated.

3. The reward calculation in SymmStaking must not have been updated yet when the attacker calls _addLiquidityProcess in SymmVesting, ensuring the transient stake still affects the reward pool.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker stakes a large amount of SYMM tokens by calling deposit in SymmStaking, triggering the _updateRewardsStates function to recalculate rewards based on the increased stake.

2. Attacker immediately withdraws the staked SYMM tokens by calling withdraw in SymmStaking with the to address set to SymmVesting, transferring the tokens before the reward state reflects the withdrawal.

3. Attacker uses the withdrawn SYMM tokens to add liquidity in SymmVesting by calling _addLiquidityProcess, manipulating price quotes or vesting states due to the transient stake.

4. Attacker claims inflated rewards from SymmStaking by calling claimRewards, as the reward calculation still reflects the large transient stake.



### Impact

- Stakers suffer an approximate loss of rewards as the attacker claims an outsized portion of the reward pool, reducing the rewards available for legitimate stakers.

- The attacker gains inflated rewards proportional to the transient stake, effectively draining value from the staking pool at the expense of other participants.

Severity
High - This vulnerability allows attackers to claim inflated rewards with minimal effort, directly impacting the fairness and integrity of the staking reward system. The attack requires only control over a large amount of SYMM tokens and precise timing, making it feasible and profitable. The economic impact on legitimate stakers and the protocol’s reputation justifies a high severity rating.

### Mitigation

To prevent this exploit, consider the following measures:
1. Synchronize Token Flows: Introduce a delay or locking mechanism in SymmStaking that prevents withdrawn tokens from being used in SymmVesting until the reward state is fully updated.

2. Immediate Reward Updates: Modify SymmStaking’s withdraw function to call _updateRewardsStates before transferring tokens, ensuring the reward calculation reflects the current stake.

3. Validate Token Source: Add a check in SymmVesting’s _addLiquidityProcess to reject tokens recently withdrawn from SymmStaking, possibly via a timestamp or state-tracking mechanism.
