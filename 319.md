# USDC Blacklisting Disrupts Protocol Functionality

## Summary
The protocolâ€™s reliance on USDC introduces risks where blacklisted users cannot claim or receive tokens, leading to stuck funds and accounting inaccuracies.

## Vulnerability Description
Circle can blacklist addresses, freezing their ability to send/receive tokens. If a user interacting with Symmio is blacklisted:
- Transfers of USDC rewards to blacklisted users revert, leaving funds stuck in the contract.
- LP tokens or vested SYMM linked to blacklisted addresses cannot be withdrawn.
- Unclaimable tokens distort supply metrics (e.g., totalVested remains high despite inaccessible tokens).

```solidity
/// @notice Internal function to claim unlocked tokens.
	/// @param token Address of the token.
	/// @param user Address of the user.
	function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();
		// Adjust the vesting plan
		totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
		vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;
		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);
		IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);
		emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
	}
```

## Likelihood
Blacklisting is rare but when triggered, critical functions (claims, withdrawals) fail for affected users.

## Impact
Blacklisted users lose access to tokens. `totalVested` does not decrease even if tokens are un-claimable. Staking rewards may over-allocate to inactive addresses.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice is blacklisted by USDC due to regulatory action.
2. Alice calls `claimUnlockedToken(USDC)`, but the transfer fails.
3. `totalVested[USDC]` remains unchanged.
4. Alice `claimedAmount` is not updated, blocking future claims.

## Recommendations
Add a fallback receiver for failed transfers. Or, allow users to update their withdrawal address preemptively.

```solidity
function claimUnlockedToken(address token) external {
    uint256 amount = vestingPlans[token][msg.sender].claimable();
    try IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount) {
        // Success
    } catch {
        IERC20(token).transfer(fallbackReceiver, amount); // Redirect on failure
    }
}
```

Decrease `totalVested` even if transfers fail to prevent metric inflation.
