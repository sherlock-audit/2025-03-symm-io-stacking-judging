# **Reward Token Removal Leading to Trapped Rewards**

## Description
The `configureRewardToken` function allows toggling the whitelist status of a reward token. However, when a token is removed while having a `pendingRewards` balance of 10 or less, those rewards become permanently inaccessible.

## Vulnerability Details
The function checks if `pendingRewards[token] > 10`, reverting if true. However, if `pendingRewards[token]` is a non-zero value but â‰¤10, the token can still be removed from the whitelist. This results in a state where the remaining rewards are locked with no way to distribute or recover them.

## Code snippet:

## Impact
Users expecting to receive these pending rewards will be unable to claim them, leading to financial loss. Additionally, it could affect trust in the system, as locked funds reduce overall contract reliability.

## Proof of Concept
1. Assume a token `TKN` is whitelisted and has `pendingRewards[TKN] = 5`.
2. The `configureRewardToken` function is called with `status = false`.
3. The token is removed from `rewardTokens`.
4. Since `pendingRewards[TKN]` is not explicitly reset or handled, these 5 tokens remain inaccessible.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Modify the function to require `pendingRewards[token] == 0` before allowing removal.
- Alternatively, ensure that any remaining `pendingRewards[token]` are redistributed before removal.
- Introduce a fallback mechanism to allow users to claim locked rewards even after token removal.
