# Inability to Add Liquidity When More Than Half of Initial Tokens Have Unlocked Due to redundant Check

### Summary

A redundant check in the `_resetVestingPlans` function, specifically:
```solidity
if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();

```
prevents users from adding liquidity once a substantial portion of their tokens has already unlocked. Because the amount of tokens the user wants to use to add liquidity will always be than the unlocked 

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231

The logic in _resetVestingPlans does not account for scenarios where the unlocked balance exceeds the new lock amount. This check incorrectly assumes that a new lock amount must always be greater than or equal to the unlocked balance

### Internal Pre-conditions

 userâ€™s vesting plan must be partially through its schedule, resulting in a high unlocked token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

A user attempts to add liquidity after claiming or unlocking a substantial portion of tokens, with the intention to lock a smaller remaining amount.

### Attack Path

User calls an addLiquidity function . when more than half vesting period is passed

The contract first claims any unlocked tokens, increasing the unlocked balance.

_resetVestingPlans is invoked to adjust the locked balance.

The contract hits the redundant check (AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis) when amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount().

The transaction reverts, preventing any additional liquidity from being added.

### Impact

Users are effectively adding liquidity to Balancer after a large portion of their tokens has vested.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Remove redundant Check
