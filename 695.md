# Griefing Attack via resetVestingPlans Locks Users Out of Vested Tokens

### Summary

The lack of constraints on resetVestingPlans will cause a severe disruption for users as an attacker with SETTER_ROLE will reduce vesting amounts to near-zero, effectively locking users out of meaningful claims and undermining trust in the protocol.



### Root Cause

in Vesting.sol:220, the resetVestingPlans function allows SETTER_ROLE to arbitrarily adjust vesting amounts for multiple users, checking only that amount >= unlockedAmount() but not enforcing a minimum threshold, enabling an attacker to set amounts to negligible values (e.g., 1 wei).



### Internal Pre-conditions

An attacker needs to gain control of SETTER_ROLE to call resetVestingPlans and modify vesting plans.

Users need to have vesting plans set up via setupVestingPlans to set vestingPlans[token][user].amount to be at least 1 SYMM token, providing targets for the attack.

The vesting period needs to be ongoing or partially completed to set vestingPlans[token][user].lockedAmount() to be greater than 0, ensuring there are unclaimed tokens to grief.



### External Pre-conditions

None required, as this issue relies solely on internal contract logic and role compromise, not external protocol changes.



### Attack Path

Attacker compromises SETTER_ROLE through phishing, governance exploit, or admin key theft.

Attacker identifies all active vesting plans by querying vestingPlans[token][user] off-chain for multiple users and tokens.

Attacker calls resetVestingPlans(token, users, amounts) with an array of users and sets each amount to 1 wei (e.g., resetVestingPlans(SYMM, [user1, user2], [1, 1])).

The contract claims any unlocked tokens via _claimUnlockedToken for each user, then resets the vesting plan to 1 wei, satisfying the amount >= unlockedAmount() check since unlocked amounts are already claimed.

Users attempt to claim remaining vested tokens via claimUnlockedToken or claimLockedToken, but find their vesting plans reduced to 1 wei, rendering further claims negligible and effectively locking them out until corrected.



### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of access to 99.9999% of their vested tokens (e.g., reducing 1M SYMM to 1 wei), severely disrupting their ability to claim funds. The attacker gains no direct financial benefit but causes significant harm to protocol reputation and user trust.

### Mitigation

Add Minimum Vesting Amount Constraint:
Introduce a minimum vesting amount to prevent negligible resets:

```solidity

uint256 public constant MIN_VESTING_AMOUNT = 1e18; // 1 SYMM minimum

function _resetVestingPlans(address token, address[] memory users, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    if (users.length != amounts.length) revert MismatchArrays();
    uint256 len = users.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];
        require(amount >= MIN_VESTING_AMOUNT, "Vesting amount too low");
        _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
        VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
        if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();
        uint256 oldTotal = vestingPlan.lockedAmount();
        vestingPlan.resetAmount(amount);
        totalVested[token] = totalVested[token] - oldTotal + amount;
        emit VestingPlanReset(token, user, amount);
    }
}
