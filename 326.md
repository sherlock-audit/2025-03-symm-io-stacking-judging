# Users Will Suffer Financial Loss Due to Slippage in Liquidity Addition

### Summary

The default slippage setting in SymmVesting.sol will cause a financial loss for users as they will receive fewer LP tokens than expected when adding liquidity in volatile markets.



### Root Cause

In SymmVesting.sol, the addLiquidity function uses a default slippage tolerance of 1% when the minLpAmount parameter is not specified (i.e., set to 0). This is implemented in the following code:
solidity

uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100;

This design choice becomes problematic in volatile markets, where rapid price changes can cause the actual number of LP tokens received to fall below the expected amount, even within the 1% slippage tolerance.

Code Analysis
The vulnerable logic is encapsulated in this line:
solidity

uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100;

Behavior: If minLpAmount is greater than 0, it uses the user-specified value. Otherwise, it calculates a minimum acceptable LP amount as 99% of the expectedLpAmount (i.e., a 1% slippage tolerance).

Issue: In volatile conditions, the actual LP tokens received may drop below this threshold due to price fluctuations between transaction submission and execution, yet the transaction will still succeed, leaving users with fewer tokens than anticipated.
```solidity
	    function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
		(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);

		// Check if usdcIn exceeds maxUsdcIn parameter
		if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();

@>		uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified

		// Retrieve pool tokens. Assumes poolTokens[0] is SYMM and poolTokens[1] is USDC.
		IERC20[] memory poolTokens = POOL.getTokens();
		(IERC20 symm, IERC20 usdc) = (poolTokens[0], poolTokens[1]);

		// Pull USDC from the user and approve the VAULT.
		usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
		usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
		symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
		PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
		PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));

		amountsIn = new uint256[](2);
		amountsIn[0] = symmIn;
		amountsIn[1] = usdcIn;

		uint256 initialLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));

		// Call the router to add liquidity.
		amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(
			address(POOL),
			amountsIn,
			expectedLpAmount,
			false, // wethIsEth: bool
			"" // userData: bytes
		);

		// Return unused usdc
		if (usdcIn - amountsIn[1] > 0) usdc.safeTransfer(msg.sender, usdcIn - amountsIn[1]);

		// Calculate actual LP tokens received by comparing balances.
		uint256 newLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));
		lpAmount = newLpBalance - initialLpBalance;

		if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
	}

### Internal Pre-conditions

For this vulnerability to manifest:
1. Users need to call addLiquidity without specifying a minLpAmount (i.e., minLpAmount = 0), triggering the default 1% slippage.

2. Market volatility must occur, causing the actual LP token issuance to deviate significantly from the expectedLpAmount within the transaction's execution window.



### External Pre-conditions

2. The price of SYMM or USDC in the liquidity pool needs to change rapidly, affecting the expectedLpAmount calculation and resulting in fewer LP tokens being issued.



### Attack Path

This is not a traditional "attack" by a malicious actor but rather a vulnerability path exploited by market conditions. The steps are:
1. User calls addLiquidity with a specific amount of SYMM and maxUsdcIn, setting minLpAmount to 0 to rely on the default slippage.

2. Market volatility occurs, causing the actual LP tokens issued to fall below the expected amount minus 1% slippage.

3. Transaction executes successfully, but the user receives fewer LP tokens than they would have expected or desired, due to the lenient default slippage.



### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of value equivalent to the difference between the expectedLpAmount and the actual LP tokens received. This loss:
- Varies with market conditions: The more volatile the market, the greater the potential shortfall.
- Is capped by 1% slippage: The maximum theoretical loss is limited by the default tolerance, but even small losses can accumulate over multiple transactions.

For example, if a user expects 100 LP tokens but receives 99 due to slippage, they lose the value represented by 1 LP token, which could be significant in a high-value pool.

Likelihood: It requires volatile market conditions, which are plausible but not guaranteed.

Impact: The financial loss is real but limited by the 1% slippage cap, making it less severe than a complete loss of funds.





### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require Explicit Slippage:
Force users to specify a minLpAmount, removing the default entirely.

Example code:
solidity

require(minLpAmount > 0, "Must specify minLpAmount to avoid slippage loss");
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount;
