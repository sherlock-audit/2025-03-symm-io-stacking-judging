# Whitelisted reward token cannot be removed from the whitelist

### Summary

Due to precision loss in the calculation of reward per token in [SymmStaking::rewardPerToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194C2-L202C3) function, reward manager will not be able to remove a reward token from the whitelist once the reward for that token is notified. Afterwards, call to [SymmStaking::configureRewardToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L312C2-L335C3) function with `status` as `false` will always revert.

### Root Cause

Assumptions to keep the report simple and easy to understand:

- only one staker with deposited balance of 500e18 SYMM tokens
- reward amount is notified for the whitelisted reward token as 50e18 (18 decimals to keep it simple)
- user claims the reward after reward period is finished

When user calls SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount function (at block.timestamp as 2000), pendingRewards[token] is updated as

```solidity
	pendingRewards[token] += amount;
        //// pendingRewards[token] = 0 + 50e18
        //// pendingRewards[token] = 50e18
```

After this, `_addRewardsForToken` function is called and `state.rate` is computed as

```solidity
            state.rate = amount / state.duration;
            //// state.rate = 50e18 / 1 weeks
            //// state.rate = 82671957671957
```

When user calls `SymmStaking::claimRewards` function, `_updateRewardsStates` function is called, it updates `state.perTokenStored` using `rewardPerToken` function. At this point, `rewardPerToken` is calculated as

```solidity
	rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
	(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
	totalSupply);
        //// rewardPerToken = 0 + (((606800 - 2000) * 82671957671957  * 1e18)/500e18)
        //// rewardPerToken = 99999999999999184
```

it updates `rewards[account][token]` using earned function. 

```solidity
		rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
                //// rewards[account][token] = 49999999999999590400
```

The earned function calculates the earned reward as

```solidity
	((balanceOf[account] * (rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken) - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])) / 1e18) +
	rewards[account][_rewardsToken];
        
        //// earned = ((500e18 * (99999999999999184 - 0)) / 1e18) + 0
        //// earned = 49999999999999590400
```

Now, _claimRewardsFor function is called, it computes a local reward variable as

```solidity
	uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
            //// reward = 49999999999999590400
```

further in this function `pendingRewards[token]` is adjusted as

```solidity
		pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
                //// pendingRewards[token] = 50e18 - 49999999999999590400
                //// pendingRewards[token] = 409600 <@ BUG
```

Here you can see, that there remains a balance in `pendingRewards[token]`

Now, reward manager wants to remove a token from the whitelist by setting its `status` as `false`. Reward manager calls `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken` and this call reverts due to below line of code

```solidlity
            //// pendingRewards[token] = 409600
            if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Detailed breakdown provided in Root Cause section.

### External Pre-conditions

Detailed breakdown provided in Root Cause section.

### Attack Path

1. User1 stakes in the protocol
2. Reward Manager whitelists a reward token
3. User2 notifies the reward for whitelisted token
4. User1 claims the reward after full duration of reward is passed
5. Reward Manager tries to remove the token from the whitelist
6. Transaction reverts

### Impact

Reward Manager will not be able to disable a whitelisted token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use libraries like PRBMath for arithmetic computations, in order to avoid precision loss.
