# `SymmStaking::rescueTokens()` Should Decrease `pendingRewards`


## Root Cause

The `rescueTokens()` function in the `SymmStaking` contract does not decrease the [pendingRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L143) mapping for the `reward token`.

As a result, withdrawing tokens via this function leaves the recorded pending rewards unchanged, even though the tokens have been removed.

```javascript
	function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```

## Recommended Mitigation

The `rescueTokens()` function should decrease the `pendingRewards` mapping for the token if it's an reward token, by the withdrawn amount:

```diff
	function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+               if (isRewardToken[token]) {
+                   pendingRewards[token] -= amount;
+               }
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
		emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
	}
```

## Summary

The `pendingRewards` mapping tracks the unclaimed rewards that will be distributed per reward token during the reward distribution period. As noted in the contest README:

> In the staking contract, if no tokens are staked, rewards will not be distributed, nor will they be carried forward to the next phase of distribution. In such scenarios, the admin will withdraw those rewards and redistribute them into the staking contract once some tokens are staked.

Currently, when the admin withdraws reward tokens with `rescueTokens()`, the `pendingRewards` mapping remains unchanged. When rewards are later redistributed using the [notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) function, two issues arise:

- The `pendingRewards` mapping for that reward token becomes overinflated because the `notifyRewardAmount()` function updates it by the same [amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L288) that was previously withdrawn. 
 This results in the system displaying more rewards than actually exist. As a consequence, users may be falsely incentivized to stake SYMM tokens, expecting a certain reward amount that will not be met when they claim their rewards.

```javascript
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
                // ...
		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                        // ...
@>			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			// ...
		}
		// ...
	}
```
  
- With the inflated `pendingRewards` value always being above `10`, the admin effectively locks himself out from being able to blacklist and remove the whitelisted reward token when necessary. This happens because the following check in the `configureRewardToken()` function will always revert when trying to remove/blacklist a reward token:

```javascript
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // ...
    if (!status) {
@>      if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
    // ...
    } else {
    // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Impact

An overinflated `pendingRewards` mapping can mislead users about the actual rewards available, potentially damaging trust in the SYMMIO protocol and reducing its appeal to investors. Users stake their tokens expecting a certain reward amount after one week, based on the `pendingRewards` value. However, when they withdraw their rewards, they receive significantly less than expected, leading to dissatisfaction and loss of confidence in the platform.

Additionally, the inability to blacklist the reward token limits the admin's ability to manage and update the token set, which could have long-term negative implications for the platform's flexibility and security.
