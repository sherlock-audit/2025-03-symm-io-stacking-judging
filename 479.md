# Exploitable Pending Rewards Threshold Blocks Token Removal in `SymmStaking::configureRewardToken`

### Summary

Current ongoing reward check in [SymmStaking::configureRewardToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320)  can be exploited through unclaimed rewards or external factors to prevent manager from delisting a whitelisted token.

### Root Cause

 The `configureRewardToken` function allows a reward manager to update a token’s whitelist status, but when removing a token, it enforces the following check,

 ```javascript
 if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
 ```

 The `pendingRewards[token]` is user-controlled; the value increases via `notifyRewardAmount` (callable by anyone) and decreases only when rewards are claimed—either by users directly or through the manager’s intervention via via `claimRewards` or `claimFor`, 

```javascript

	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
@>				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}


```

Malicious actors can get around that to ensure that manager cannot delist a token. So, if `_claimRewardsFor` fails, the `pendingRewards[token]` would hold amount above threshold since `_claimRewardsFor`  is the only function that decrements the `pendingRewards[token]` so tripping that would disrupt functionality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `pendingRewards[token]` must be > threshold.
2. Actors add amounts > threshold of 10 (or updated threshold) over time so `pendingRewards[token]` always holds a value.
3. Actor doesn't claim rewards intentionally.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Actors needs to intentionally blacklist themselves.

### Attack Path

The current design assumes timely reward claims, but if users fail to claim (intentionally or not), or if they’re blacklisted by whitelisted token (i.e., USDT), it would DoS the `configureRewardToken` when blacklisting a reward token. There's the `claimFor` function manager could use to send rewards to user forcefully, but to get around that, one or multiple users could stake from an address and intentionally get the address blacklisted by the whitelisted token via foul play so the address gets blacklisted resulting in DoS in `configureRewardToken` functionality because that would ensure that `pendingRewards[token]`  stays high, locking the token in the whitelist and thwarting manager intent. 

Plus, the fixed threshold of 10 is too small. If an arbitrary user adds even a small reward amount, it would distrupt status changes so using `pendingRewards[token]` isn't the right check for ongoing reward distribution. It should check `periodFinish` which actually denotes when a period has finished. Flipping a status to false for a token after periodFinish doesn't impact claim rewards for users so it's safe to do.

### Impact

The reward manager cannot blacklist a token if unclaimed rewards exceed threshold.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider the following,

1. Making threshold dynamic. 
2. The check should be changed to consider the `periodFinish` instead. Once a period finishes, token should be removed if not needed.

```diff
+ 	TokenRewardState memory state = rewardState[token];

- if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
+ if (block.timestamp <= state.periodFinish) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);


```

3. If protocol intends `pendingRewards[token]` to be deciding factor for changing status, then consider decreasing `pendingRewards` when earned amount is calculated in `_updateRewardsStates`,

```diff
+       uint256 existingRewards = rewards[account][token];
				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token); // @ updated rewards (includes existing)
				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
+       pendingRewards[token] -= rewards[account][token] - existingRewards;
```
