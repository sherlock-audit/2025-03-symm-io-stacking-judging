# Trusted OPERATOR_ROLE will cause financial loss for users as penalties are incorrectly applied to unlocked tokens.

### Summary

The missing check in _claimLockedToken will cause financial loss for users as the OPERATOR_ROLE or users will incorrectly incur penalties when claiming tokens after the vesting period has ended.

### Root Cause

In Vesting.sol, the _claimLockedToken function applies a penalty to locked token claims without checking whether the vesting period has ended. If the vesting period has ended, all tokens should be unlocked, and no penalty should apply.

```solidity
function claimLockedTokenFor(address token, address user, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
		_claimLockedToken(token, user, amount);
	}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The SETTER_ROLE must set up a vesting plan with a valid startTime and endTime.

The vesting period must have ended (i.e., the current time is greater than endTime).

The user or OPERATOR_ROLE must call claimLockedToken or claimLockedTokenFor.



### External Pre-conditions

non

### Attack Path

The SETTER_ROLE sets up a vesting plan for User A with startTime = 1000 and endTime = 2000.

The current time reaches 3000, which is after the vesting period has ended.

User A calls claimLockedToken to claim their tokens.

The _claimLockedToken function applies a penalty to the claimed tokens, even though the vesting period has ended.



### Impact

The user suffers an approximate loss of (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18 tokens due to the incorrectly applied penalty. The lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver gains this amount, but the loss is unfair to the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in _claimLockedToken to ensure penalties are only applied if the tokens are still locked (i.e., the current time is before the vesting end time):

```solidity
Copy
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];

    // Ensure tokens are still locked
    if (block.timestamp >= vestingPlan.endTime) {
        revert("Vesting period has ended");
    }

    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    // Adjust the vesting plan
    vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
    totalVested[token] -= amount;
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

    // Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

    IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
    IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

    emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
}
```
This ensures that penalties are only applied when tokens are still locked, protecting users from unfair losses.
