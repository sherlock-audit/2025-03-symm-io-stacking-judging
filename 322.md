# Insufficient Decimal Precision of Reward Rate

### Summary
The reward rate's decimal precision is insufficient, leading to potential inaccuracies in reward calculations.

### Root Cause
The reward rate's decimal precision matches that of the reward token. 
However, since the calculation involves division by a large number (duration), this can result in significant precision loss, especially for tokens with fewer decimals (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals).

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
370:		state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

### PoC
Consider the following scenario:
    `duration := 7 days = 604,800 seconds`, `amount := $580`
Calculating the reward rate:
    `state.rate = 592e6 / 604,800 = 958.9947`
The precision loss in the reward rate is: 0.9947.
This value represents a loss greater than 0.1% of the reward rate (958).

### Impact
Users may experience a loss in rewards due to the insufficient precision in the reward rate calculations, leading to unfair distributions.

### Mitigation
Consider increasing the decimal precision of the reward rate.
