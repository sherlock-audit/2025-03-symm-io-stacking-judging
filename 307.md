# Grief attack via `notifyRewardAmount()` results in no rewards earned by SYMM stakers

### Summary
Lack of access control in `notifyRewardAmount()` function will cause SYMM token stakers to get zero rewards as any malicious user can perform a grief attack, resulting in reward rate = 0.

### Root Cause

In `SymmStaking.sol`, the `notifyRewardAmount()` allows anyone to call it.

There is also no minimum amount of rewards that one can deposit into SYMMStaking.sol.

### Attack Path
Assume the reward period has ended, and current block.timestamp > state.periodFinish.

1. Bob sees this and calls `notifyRewardAmount()`, with reward token = USDC and amount = 1 wei. 
2. Bob safeTransfers just 1 wei worth of USDC to SYMMStaking.sol
3. `addRewardsForToken()` is now called.
4. If statement will execute. Assuming state.duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION, state.rate = 1 / 604800 = 0 (round down).
5. As reward rate is now 0, all stakers who subsequently claim their rewards will get 0 rewards.

### Impact
Reward rate is easily manipulated, and stakers will not get any rewards for the SYMM they have staked. This is because anyone can donate very low amount of reward tokens, affecting the reward rate.

### Mitigation
1. Limit the `notifyRewardAmount()` function to only be able to be called by trusted admin.
2. Set a minimum amount of reward tokens to be transferred via `notifyRewardAmount()` function.
