# Permissionless `notifyRewardAmount()` function can disrupt rewards distribution

### Summary

Anyone can extend the `periodFinish` and decrease reward rate by calling permissionless `notifyRewardAmount()` function from `SymmStaking.sol`, resulting in users receiving fewer rewards than expected within the same time period.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292)

Function `notifyRewardAmount()` can be called by anyone, then the function calls internal `_addRewardsForToken()`, which recalculates new reward rate based on sum of `leftover` rewards + new reward divided by `duration`. 
```solidity
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
The new rate will be significantly lower than the previous one, which will result in the distribution of rewards being significantly slower.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. 70_000 USDT are distributed over `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` period (10_000 per day);
2. 4 days has passed, stakers already claimed 40_000 USDT and expecting to claim remaining 30_000 during next 3 days;
3. Amelie calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei USDT, so `rewardState[token]` updated as follows:
```solidity
uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;  //3 days remains to periodFinish 

uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; //30_000 USDT should be distributed for 3 days

state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;  // (1 + 30_000) / 1 week = 4286 USDT per day
```
4. Users now can claim only 4286 USDT per day, which is significantly smaller than expected, also they forced to lock their stakes for 11 days (4 days longer) if they want to receive remaining rewards;
5. Amelie can repeat the attack again and again and decrease rate exponentially.

### Impact

Reward distribution will be significantly slower - users will receive significantly less rewards per the same time periods, so they will be forced to lock their funds longer than expected.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Recommended to allow only trusted `REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE` to call `notifyRewardAmount()` with amounts, that will not harm stakers.
