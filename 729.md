# Incorrect check in `_resetVestingPlans`

### Summary

There is a Check: [`if (amount < vestingPlan.unlockedAmount()) revert AlreadyClaimedMoreThanThis();`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L231) which is unnecessary and DoSes functionality.

### Root Cause

This check is unnecessary because:

1. Vesting period is reset – When resetAmount(amount) is called, the start and end time are updated, making previous unlockedAmount() calculations irrelevant.
2. New amount applies to a new time window – Since the vesting period is reset, past unlocks don’t matter anymore.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A vesting admin tries to update a user's vesting plan with a lower amount.
2. The function reverts because the new amount is less than the previously unlocked tokens.
3. The vesting plan remains stuck in its old state, making it impossible to adjust.
4. If the old vesting parameters are incorrect, the user may face delays or lose access to their rightful tokens.

### Impact

Unnecessary DoS.
