# Precision Loss in rewardPerToken Function Leads to Reduced User Rewards

### Summary

In the SymmStaking contract, the rewardPerToken function suffers from precision loss due to integer division, which results in users receiving fewer rewards than expected.
```solidity
(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
                totalSupply);
```


If the reward token is USDC (with 6 decimals on Base chain), the rate precision is 6, and if totalSupply exceeds 1e6 * 1e18, precision loss can cause each staked token to lose approximately 1 USDC reward.

With Symm’s current supply of 405,556,694.27, reaching a totalSupply of 1,000,000 staked tokens is very likely, meaning significant user reward losses.

### Root Cause

In the [SymmStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L200-L201), the calculation in rewardPerToken does not properly account for decimal precision, causing integer division to truncate values.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Total staked tokens: totalSupply = 1,000,000 * 1e18

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.	Initial Conditions
•	Total staked tokens: totalSupply = 1,500,000 * 1e18 (1.5 million tokens).
•	Reward rate: rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate = 1e6 (USDC rewards, 1 USDC per second).
•	Time difference: lastTimeRewardApplicable - lastUpdated = 1 (1-second reward interval).
2.	Calling rewardPerToken() 
•	Calculation formula(The call time is not easy to judge, but it can be controlled by anyone):
`((1 * 1e6 * 1e18) / (1,500,000 * 1e18)) = 1e6 / 1,500,000 = 0.666666 USDC`
•	Since Solidity does not support decimals, 0.666666 gets truncated to 0, meaning all rewards are lost for this period.
•	If totalSupply = 1,000,001 * 1e18 (10 million tokens), each staked token loses ~1 USDC.
•	If totalSupply = 100,000,001 * 1e18 (100 million tokens), each staked token loses ~10 USDC.
•	The more users stake, the greater the cumulative reward loss.


### Impact

•	Users receive fewer staking rewards than expected.
•	Project credibility is at risk due to inconsistent reward calculations.
•	Lower staking incentives may decrease TVL and user participation.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to expand the calculation accuracy.
