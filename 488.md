# Malicious actors will indefinitely extend reward periods affecting all stakers

### Summary

The incorrect reward duration extension mechanism will cause unfair reward distribution for all stakers as malicious reward providers will be able to indefinitely extend reward periods through small, frequent deposits to manipulate distribution timelines.

[LOC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L378)

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:371-372](https://github.com/2025-03-symm-io-stacking-ihtisham-sudo/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L371-L372) the reward period finish time is always reset to `block.timestamp + state.duration` regardless of whether adding rewards to an existing period or starting a new one:

```solidity
state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
```

This design flaw allows continuous extension of reward periods by repeatedly adding small reward amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward token must be properly registered via `configureRewardToken`
2. The reward period must be active (`block.timestamp < state.periodFinish`)
3. The attacker must call `notifyRewardAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a minimal amount of reward tokens
2. The `_addRewardsForToken` function calculates a new rate that accounts for leftover rewards
3. But critically, it incorrectly extends `periodFinish` by a full reward duration (`state.duration`)
4. Attacker repeats step 1 frequently (e.g., daily) to continuously extend the reward period
5. This process can be repeated indefinitely, as each call extends the distribution period


### Impact

This issue can lead to extending the reward duration beyond the intended time period, causing rewards to be distributed over a longer duration than initially planned. This could result in users receiving smaller rewards over time.

### Mitigation

Update the `notifyRewardAmount` function to extend the reward duration only when required
