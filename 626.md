# Possible loss of funds, transfer functions can silently fail via unsafe methods

### Summary

Possible loss of funds, transfer functions can silently fail. The token vesting contract uses unsafe ERC20 transfer() calls that can fail silently, potentially locking user funds.

ReadMe states
>>**If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?**

>>Only whitelisted tokens can work with the codebase, and these include stable-coins such as USDC, **USDT**, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM.

### Root Cause

In [`_claimUnlockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L272) function, `IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount)` The `transfer()` call lacks return value validation and uses an unsafe ERC20 pattern. When interacting with non-compliant tokens (e.g., USDT), this may revert unexpectedly or fail silently, leaving contract state updated `(totalVested, claimedAmount)` while tokens remain undelivered.

In [`_claimLockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L295-L296) function, `IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty)` & `IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty)` Both transfers use unsafe methods, risking partial failures where penalties might be collected but user funds not delivered (or vice versa)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users need to call the `claimUnlockedToken` function which extends to call the `_claimLockedToken`, hence unsafe Transfer method is called.

2. The `claimUnlockedToken` needs to be called which extends to call the `claimUnlockedToken`, leading to the call of the unsafe Transfer method.

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

Nil

### Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value. This will lead to loss of user funds.
e.g USDT

### PoC

The following functions makes use of ERC20's `transferFrom()` in following contracts:

```solidity
	function _claimUnlockedToken(address token, address user) internal {
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		uint256 claimableAmount = vestingPlan.claimable();


		// Adjust the vesting plan
		totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;
		vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;


		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, claimableAmount);


		IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount);   // @audit b


		emit UnlockedTokenClaimed(token, user, claimableAmount);
	}
```

```solidity
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();


		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;


		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);


		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);          // @audit 
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);    // @here


		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
```

The issue here is with the use of unsafe `transfer()` function. The `ERC20.transfer()` function return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

Some tokens like `USDT` don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their transfer() function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

 There could be silent failure in transfer which may lead to loss of user funds in `vesting._claimLockedToken` and `vesting._claimUnlockedToken`

### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the `safeTransfer()` function instead of `transfer()`.

Example
```solidity
--- IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount); 
+++ IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount); 
```
