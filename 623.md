# Precision Loss in SymmStaking#_addRewardsForToken Reward Distribution

### Summary

Integer division truncation in the reward rate calculation causes a significant portion of reward tokens to become undistributable to stakers. When small reward amounts are added or tokens with few decimals (like USDC) are used, the division operation [amount / state.duration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L370) truncates decimal values, resulting in those tokens becoming inaccessible through the normal reward distribution mechanism. 

### Root Cause

In [SymmStaking.sol:355-356 and 359-360](https://github.com/your-repo/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L355-356), the reward rate calculation uses integer division without scaling:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
    state.rate = amount / state.duration;  <= precision loss as it must have used amount * 1e18 to prevent precision loss
} else {
    uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
    state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
}
```

This truncation means that if `amount` is smaller than `state.duration`, the rate will be zero, and the rewards cannot be distributed. Even for larger amounts, a portion (up to `state.duration - 1` tokens) may be lost to truncation with each reward notification.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Reward token amount (`amount`) added must be smaller than or comparable to the duration time in seconds (`state.duration`), which is set to `1 weeks` (604,800 seconds) by default
2. The contract must be used with reward tokens that have few decimal places (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals) or with relatively small reward amounts

### External Pre-conditions

Nonw

### Attack Path

1. Reward manager calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with token amounts that trigger the truncation issue
2. The internal function `_addRewardsForToken()` calculates `rate = amount / state.duration` which truncates to a smaller value or zero
3. Reward tokens become undistributable through normal reward distribution channels
4. The accounting system becomes increasingly inaccurate as the actual distributed rewards are less than what's tracked in `pendingRewards`

### Impact

For tokens with fewer decimals like USDC, this represents significant financial loss that compounds over time - small daily distributions could lose over 6% of total rewards annually. Users consistently receive fewer rewards than what contract accounting indicates they've earned.

### Mitigation

Multiply the amount by 1e18 before diving by the duration to mitigate rounding errors and prevent precision loss.

```diff
if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
-		      state.rate = amount / state.duration;
+                     state.rate = amount * 1e18 / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
```
