# Tokens can be double claimed in `claimLockedToken()` through 'resetAmount()'

### Summary

When a user claims locked tokens through the [`Vesting:claimLockedToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L299), the contract calls the `resetAmount()` function to adjust the vesting plan. However, this function resets the `claimedAmount` back to zero and restarts the vesting schedule. As a result, a user who has already claimed unlocked tokens can later re-earn and claim tokens they had already received, effectively allowing a double claim

### Root Cause

```solidity
// Line 290
vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
```

The core issue stems from using `resetAmount` for partial locked token claims. This function is designed to completely reinitialize the vesting plan rather than adjust it incrementally. By resetting the `claimedAmount` and vesting timeline, the contract loses the record of previously claimed tokens, breaking the invariant that the total tokens claimed plus those remaining should equal the original allocation. This oversight enables users to claim more tokens than they were originally vested.

### Attack Path

### Initial Setup
- A user has 100 tokens set to vest over a period.
- At a certain time, say T, the vesting schedule has released 30 tokens.
- The user claims these 30 unlocked tokens, so `claimedAmount` becomes 30
- This leaves 70 tokens still locked (i.e. $100 - 30 = 70$) 

### **Step 1: Claiming Locked Tokens**
Now the user decides to claim 20 tokens from the locked portion (with a penalty applied). When they call `claimLockedToken()`:
- The function first calls `_claimUnlockedToken()`, but since the user has already claimed all unlocked tokens ($30−30=0$ remaining), no additional tokens are transferred.
- Next, it verifies that the locked amount (70 tokens) is sufficient to cover the 20 tokens requested
- Then, the contract calls `resetAmount()` with the parameter $lockedAmount−20=70−20=50$

### Step 2: The Reset Process
The `resetAmount()` function is meant to reinitialize the vesting plan. However, it does the following:
- It resets `startTime` to the current block timestamp and adjusts `endTime` accordingly
- It sets the new total vested amount to 50 tokens (the locked tokens minus the claimed locked amount).
- It sets `claimedAmount` back to 0—even though the user had already claimed 30 unlocked tokens.

### Step 3: The Double-Claim Opportunity
After this reset, the vesting plan appears as if:
- **Total Vested Amount**: 50 tokens remain
- **Claimed Tokens:** 0 tokens have been claimed (because of the reset)
- The vesting schedule now starts from the time of reset.

Because the history of the 30 already claimed tokens has been erased, if the user calls `claimUnlockedToken()` later, the calculation for claimable tokens will be based on the new vesting plan: $claimable=new unlockedAmount−0$

As time passes in the new schedule, the user can eventually claim up to 50 tokens in addition to the 30 tokens already received and the 20 tokens from the locked claim


### Impact

In a correct implementation, the sum of already claimed tokens and tokens still to be unlocked would never exceed the originally vested amount. But here, by wiping out the `claimedAmount` history, it breaks the accounting invariant because the user can eventually claim the tokens they already received, plus additional tokens that unlock under the new schedule. 

Thus, even though under normal logic a user shouldn't be able to claim more than they were vested, the bug creates a situation where the user ends up with more than their intended allocation effectively a double claim which can undermine the original token distribution

### Mitigation

Instead of using `resetAmount()`, directly adjust `amount` and preserve `claimedAmount`
