# Loss of rewards due to griefing attack

### Summary

Per the Audit ReadMe, the protocol will be deployed on Base

In Base, low transaction fees enable malicious users to exploit the USDC and USDT reward feature, resulting in a loss of USDC rewards (for users).

### Root Cause

On Base, [Symm](https://basescan.org/token/0x800822d361335b4d5f352dac293ca4128b5b605f#readContract#F5) has a decimal of 18 and USDC's lower precision of [6 decimals](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913#readProxyContract#F11) and frequent reward updates will cause stakers to receive 0 of the allotted rewards

Whenever 
- `deposit()`
- `notifyRewardAmount()`
- `withdraw()`
- `claimRewards()`
are called, `_updateRewardsStates()` is triggered thus updating the `state.perTokenStored` and the `state.lastUpdated` variables

```solidity
File: token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol
406: 	function _updateRewardsStates(address account) internal {
407: 		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
408: 		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
409: 			address token = rewardTokens[i];
410: 			TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];
411: 
412: 	@>		state.perTokenStored = rewardPerToken(token);
413: 	@>		state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);
414: 
415: 			if (account != address(0)) {
416: 				rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
417: 				userRewardPerTokenPaid[account][token] = state.perTokenStored;
418: 			}
419: 			unchecked {
420: 				++i;
421: 			}
422: 		}
423: 	}

```
looking at the `rewardPerToken()` function below, `(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) / totalSupply);` will round down to zero if the numerator is less than `totalSupply`

```solidity
File: token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol
194: 	function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
195: 		if (totalSupply == 0) {
196: 			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
197: 		}
198: 		return
199: 			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
200: 			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
201: 				totalSupply);
202: 	}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Malicious user calls deposit regularly in intervals that render the rewards rate to zero
- timing difference used in rewards calculation is updated often by most user interactions
- USDC and USDT decimals are not scaled properly

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- reward `token` = USDC or USDT
- `amount` = 10_000e6
- `state.duration` = 7 days = 604,800s
- `state.rate = amount / state.duration`
    - = 10_000e6 / 604800 =  16,534 (wei per second)
- `totalSupply` = 1_000_000e18 (this can increase and can even be more

The goal is for the calculation on L200 above evaluates to less than `totalSupply` and thus round down i.e
- `(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) < totalSupply)`
    - `((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * 16534 * 1e18` < `1_000_000e18`
    - `((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated)` < `1_000_000 / 16534` = 60
- hence any time anyone triggers `_updateRewardsStates()` within 60 seconds, `rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated` is updated and `rewardPerToken()` evaluates to zero
    - and any user claiming  after this gets zero reward and as such gets no rewards

Worse yet is that an attacker can make it a point of duty to call `deposit()` or other functions that trigger `_updateRewardsStates()` every 60 seconds and as such cause stakers to miss out entirely on their rewards

**PS**: the rewards can be swept from the contract by the admin, but this issue is a problem because the stakers loose out entirely and do not earn anything

### Impact

Users do not receive their rewards

### PoC

The same applies to USDT since it also has [6 decimals](https://basescan.org/token/0xfde4C96c8593536E31F229EA8f37b2ADa2699bb2#readContract#F3) on base

### Mitigation

Consider scaling appropriately for USDC and USDT rewards to sustain the precision and allow users to earn their due rewards
