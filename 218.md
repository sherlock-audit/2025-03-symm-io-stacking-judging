# Rewards dilution and loss in _addRewardsForToken

Summary
when adding rewards via notifyRewardAmount for distribution you can dilute rewards for existing stakers 
and overlapping of reward periods is possible.
Vulnerability Detail
` _addRewardsForToken ` is being called when new reward amount is being added for distribution to calculate the rate and duration for distribution of rewards 

	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;   
	}

in case of existing running rewards period with duration = 7 days , when we add 1 wei of token rewards we extend the duration for distribution with extra 7 days diluting the rewards for existing stakers.

Total Rewards = 10,000 tokens
Duration = 7 days
Daily Rate = 10,000 / 7 = 1,428.57 tokens per day
on the 6 day the attacker adds 1 wei , and extends the `state.periodFinish` with `state.duration` = 7 days  , now for existing stakers their  remaining = 1,428.57(1 remaining day) tokens are extended  for another 7 days (1 wei + 1,428.57) / 7 days = 204.08 tokens per day , diluting their rewards , and their  "leftover" rewards will be shared with new stakers that enter in the next period , causing loss of rewards for the initial stakers from the first rewards period .

Impact 

 extending and overlapping of reward periods will lead to rewards dilution and loss for existing stakers .

 manual review

Recommendation
incorporate another way for starting a new reward period without affecting the current one .
