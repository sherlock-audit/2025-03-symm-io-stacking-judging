# SymmVesting Contract Token Sequence Not Validated Creates Serious Security Risks

## Summary

SymmVesting contracts handle liquidity by simply assuming that the first token in the array returned by the pool is SYMM and the second is USDC, without any validation. If the order of tokens in the pool changes, this can lead to token confusion, loss of funds and failure of liquidity operations.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L181

```solidity
function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    (uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);

    // Check if usdcIn exceeds maxUsdcIn parameter
    if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();

    uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified

    // Retrieve pool tokens. Assumes poolTokens[0] is SYMM and poolTokens[1] is USDC.
    IERC20[] memory poolTokens = POOL.getTokens();
@>  (IERC20 symm, IERC20 usdc) = (poolTokens[0], poolTokens[1]);

    // Pull USDC from the user and approve the VAULT.
    usdc.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), usdcIn);
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
    PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
    PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
}
```

Similarly, there is a similar problem in the `getLiquidityQuote` function:.

```solidity
function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
    uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
@>  uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
@>  uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];

    usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
    usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
    lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
}
```

The contract directly assumes that the order of tokens returned by POOL is fixed, i.e. the first one is SYMM and the second one is USDC. In reality, however, the order of tokens in the pool may change, especially if there is a possibility of updating or migrating the pool contract. When the order of tokens is not as expected, this can lead to confusion between the SYMM and USDC variables, which can cause a number of serious problems.

## Internal pre-conditions

1. SymmVesting contracts rely on the POOL contract's getTokens() to return a fixed-order array of tokens.
2. The contract does not verify that the deconstructed token addresses match the stored SYMM and USDC addresses.

## External pre-conditions

1. the implementation of POOL contract changes, resulting in a change of the order of tokens returned by getTokens()
2. The list of tokens in the pool is modified or upgraded.
3. An administrator or privileged role manipulates the order of tokens in the pool.

## Attack Path

1. an attacker (with sufficient privileges) can modify the token order of the POOL contract
2. the user calls the addLiquidity or addLiquidityByPercentage function
3. the contract gets tokens from the POOL and is incorrectly deconstructed
4. Wrong tokens are used for transfers, authorizations and liquidity operations
5. User funds are sent to the wrong address or used in the wrong ratio

## Impact

1. Loss of user funds: USDC may be sent to the wrong contract or address
2. Incorrect price calculation: If the order of tokens is reversed, the price calculation will be completely wrong
3. Failed transaction: If the token does not match the expected interface, the transaction may be rolled back.
4. in extreme cases, malicious tokens may be used to replace legitimate tokens, leading to theft of funds

## PoC

This can be verified by creating a simulated POOL contract that returns an array of tokens in reverse order, and then calling SymmVesting's addLiquidity function.

## Mitigation

Add explicit validation to ensure that the correct tokens are used, regardless of the return order:

```solidity
IERC20[] memory poolTokens = POOL.getTokens();
IERC20 symm;
IERC20 usdc;

if (address(poolTokens[0]) == SYMM && address(poolTokens[1]) == USDC) {
    symm = poolTokens[0];
    usdc = poolTokens[1];
} else if (address(poolTokens[1]) == SYMM && address(poolTokens[0]) == USDC) {
    symm = poolTokens[1];
    usdc = poolTokens[0];
} else {
    revert("Pool tokens do not match expected SYMM and USDC addresses");
}
```

Similarly, the `getLiquidityQuote` function should perform a similar validation to ensure that the correct token balance is used for the calculation.
