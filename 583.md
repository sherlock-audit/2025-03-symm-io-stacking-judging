# Unspecified percentage precision might result in confusion.

### Summary

Using an uncommon percentage precision (1e16 instead of the more standard 1e4) may cause confusion, leading users to unintentionally add a smaller fraction of their locked SYMM tokens to liquidity than intended.

### Root Cause

In [SymmVesting.sol#L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L120), the percentage of locked SYMM tokens a user wants to allocate to liquidity is passed as a parameter and used in the following formula:
```solidity
uint256 amount = (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, SYMM) * percentage) / 1e18;
```
This formula calculates the corresponding token amount based on the provided percentage. However, for the calculation to be accurate, the percentage must be in the 1e18 format (where 1e18 represents 100%).

It is more common practice to express percentages in 1e4 format, where 10,000 represents 100%. This discrepancy may lead to confusion, as users might pass 10,000 expecting to allocate 100% of their tokens but instead end up contributing only a fraction of their intended amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

///

### External Pre-conditions

///

### Attack Path

1. User calls `addLiquidityByPercentage` function and passed 10000 as percentage, expecting to add 100% of his locked tokens to liquidity
2. In the end user only adds a small fraction of his liquidity, not 100%

### Impact

User adds to liqudity less, than expected 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Specify directly, that passed percentage must be in e16 format (100*10e16)
Or
2.  Use more common percentage precision (1e4) and change the formula to
```solidity
uint256 amount = (getLockedAmountsForToken(msg.sender, SYMM) * percentage * 1e14 ) / 1e18;
```
