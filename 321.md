# Reward Distribution Delay Vulnerability

### Summary
The reward distribution period in the contract can be delayed indefinitely due to a vulnerability in the `notifyRewardAmount` function.

### Root Cause
The function is callable by anyone, allowing a malicious user to exploit it and indefinitely delay the reward distribution.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275
```solidity
	function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366
```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```
A malicious user can call the notifyRewardAmount function with a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) before the periodFinish. 
This call extends the periodFinish, allowing the reward distribution period to be increased indefinitely.

### Impact
the reward distribution period could be delayed indefinitely

### Mitigation
Consider the following mitigations.
1. Limit access to the notifyRewardAmount function to specific roles.
2. Implement a minimum threshold for the reward amount.
