# Token Approvals Not Revoked will lead to token theft through lingering permissions

### Summary


The failure to revoke token approvals after router transactions will cause a loss of funds for the SymmVesting contract as attackers can exploit lingering approvals to drain tokens if any transaction partially fails.




### Root Cause

In [SymmVesting.sol:185-188](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L185C3-L188C84) the contract approves tokens for the Permit2 contract but never revokes these approvals after the router call completes:

```solidity
usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must call `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityByPercentage` to convert some of their locked SYMM to LP tokens
2. The transaction must partially succeed - specifically approving tokens, but failing at some point during or after the router call
3. The SymmVesting contract must have token approvals active in the Permit2 contract


### External Pre-conditions

1. The router operation must fail after approvals are set but before they are consumed
2. SYMM and USDC tokens must be approved to the Permit2 contract with non-zero amounts



### Attack Path

1. User calls `addLiquidity(amount, minLpAmount, maxUsdcIn)`
2. The contract approves SYMM and USDC to the Permit2 contract
3. The Permit2 contract approves these tokens to the router
4. The router operation fails (e.g., due to slippage, pool conditions, or out-of-gas)
5. The approvals remain active in the Permit2 contract
6. An attacker notices the lingering approvals through monitoring events
7. The attacker calls the Permit2 contract directly to transfer tokens from the SymmVesting contract to themselves using the existing approvals


### Impact

The SymmVesting contract suffers a loss of SYMM and USDC tokens that were approved but not used in the failed transaction. The attacker gains these tokens, potentially draining significant value from the contract. Since the approval amounts can be up to the full amount a user is trying to add as liquidity, substantial amounts of tokens could be stolen in a single attack.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a pattern that revokes approvals after the router operations, using a try-catch or similar mechanism:

```solidity
function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Set approvals
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
    PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
    PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
    
    // ...router operation...
    
    // Revoke all approvals after the operation completes (successful or not)
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0);
    
    // Note: For Permit2, approvals are already consumed by the router if successful,
    // but consider implementing a function to revoke them if the router call fails
    
    // ...remaining code...
}
```

Alternatively, use a more secure pattern with exact approvals and immediate revocation:

```solidity
try {
    // Set approvals
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), usdcIn);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), symmIn);
    PERMIT2.approve(SYMM, address(ROUTER), uint160(symmIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
    PERMIT2.approve(USDC, address(ROUTER), uint160(usdcIn), uint48(block.timestamp));
    
    // Router operation
    amountsIn = ROUTER.addLiquidityProportional(...);
} finally {
    // Always revoke approvals
    usdc.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0);
    symm.approve(address(PERMIT2), 0);
}
```
