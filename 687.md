# Precision Loss in Penalty Calculation Allows Penalty-Free Early Claims

### Summary

The use of integer division in penalty calculations in _claimLockedToken will cause an unfair advantage for users as they will claim small locked amounts without incurring penalties due to precision truncation



### Root Cause

In Vesting.sol:344, the _claimLockedToken function calculates the penalty as amount * lockedClaimPenalty / 1e18, where integer division truncates fractional values, resulting in zero penalties for small amounts when lockedClaimPenalty = 0.5e18 (50%).



### Internal Pre-conditions

Users need to have a vesting plan set up via setupVestingPlans to set vestingPlans[token][user].amount to be at least 1 SYMM token.

The vesting period needs to be ongoing to set vestingPlans[token][user].lockedAmount() to be greater than 0, enabling locked token claims.

The lockedClaimPenalty variable needs to be set to exactly 0.5e18 (50%) during initialization to enforce the intended penalty rate.





### External Pre-conditions

None required, as this issue is internal to the contract's logic and does not depend on external protocol changes.



### Attack Path

Admin calls setupVestingPlans to assign 1,000,000 SYMM tokens to a user with a 6-month vesting period starting February 23, 2025.

After 1 month (March 23, 2025), approximately 166,667 SYMM tokens are unlocked, leaving 833,333 SYMM locked.

User repeatedly calls claimLockedToken(token, 1e18) to claim 1 SYMM at a time from the locked amount.

The penalty calculation in _claimLockedToken computes penalty = 1e18 * 0.5e18 / 1e18 = 0.5e18 / 1e18 = 0 (truncated to 0 due to integer division).

The contract transfers 1 SYMM to the user with no penalty deducted, allowing the user to incrementally claim all locked tokens penalty-free by exploiting small amounts.



### Impact

The users suffer no penalty on small early claims, potentially extracting up to 100% of their locked tokens without penalty over time. The protocol’s penalty mechanism is undermined, reducing fairness and incentive alignment for non-unlockers and ecosystem participants.

        uint256 penaltyReceiverBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(penaltyReceiver);

        console.log("User received:", userBalance / 1e18, "SYMM");
        console.log("Penalty receiver received:", penaltyReceiverBalance / 1e18, "SYMM");

        // Assert no penalty applied
        assertEq(userBalance, 1e18, "User received full amount without penalty");
        assertEq(penaltyReceiverBalance, 0, "Penalty receiver received unexpected amount");
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Use _mulDivUp for Rounding Up:
Replace the integer division with OpenZeppelin’s Math.mulDiv using upward rounding to ensure small penalties are not truncated:

```solidity

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Math.sol";

function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
    totalVested[token] -= amount;
    uint256 penalty = Math.mulDiv(amount, lockedClaimPenalty, 1e18, Math.Rounding.Up);

    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

    IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
    IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

    emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
}
```
This ensures that even small amounts (e.g., 1 SYMM) yield a non-zero penalty (e.g., 0.5 SYMM).
