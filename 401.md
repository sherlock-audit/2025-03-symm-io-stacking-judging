# Malicious user can call notifyrewardamount to drift periodfinish and dilute the reward furthur


## Summary
The notifyRewardAmount function lacks proper access control, allowing anyone to call it..So called freuently, this function extends the period finish by 1 week.
This cause the reward to be distributed a longer period , reducing the reward rate since the reward amount is spread out over an extended period.


```
function notifyRewardAmount(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));
		if (tokens.length != amounts.length) revert ArraysMismatched();

		uint256 len = tokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			address token = tokens[i];
			uint256 amount = amounts[i];

			if (amount == 0) continue;
			if (!isRewardToken[token]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(token);

			IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
			pendingRewards[token] += amount;
			_addRewardsForToken(token, amount);
		}
		emit RewardNotified(tokens, amounts);
	}
```


## Root Cause
notifyRewardAmount lacks access control
.
## Internal preconditions
## External preconditions
## Attack Path
1. Malicious user calls notifyRewardAmount on day 3 of a 7-day reward distribution, with 70 reward tokens in total.
2. 3 days have passed, and 30 tokens have already been distributed. There are 40 tokens left to be distributed over the remaining 4 days.
3. By calling notifyRewardAmount, the reward period (periodFinish) is extended by 1 week, making the remaining 40 tokens distributed over 7 days instead of 4 days.
## Impact
1. Dilution of Rewards: The frequent extension of the reward period causes the same total rewards to be spread over a longer duration, reducing the reward rate.
2. Slower Reward Distribution: Users will receive their rewards more slowly as the rewards are now distributed over an extended period, affecting the expected reward period.
## POC
## Mitigation
add similar modifier as in [Syntetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L113) notifyRewardAmount function.
