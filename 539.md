# Default slippage protection in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` is insufficient

### Summary

The `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` function quotes current live balances of the Balancer V3 pool to check for slippage. In case no `minLpAmount` is set in the call of the transaction, the system offers a **default slippage protection of 1%**. This default slippage protection is insufficient because the `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote` returned values rely on the in-block data that can change because of unintentional front-running. 

### Root Cause

In the `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` function,
[SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L171-L213)
```solidity
	function _addLiquidity(uint256 symmIn, uint256 minLpAmount, uint256 maxUsdcIn) internal returns (uint256[] memory amountsIn, uint256 lpAmount) {
		(uint256 usdcIn, uint256 expectedLpAmount) = getLiquidityQuote(symmIn);


		// Check if usdcIn exceeds maxUsdcIn parameter
		if (maxUsdcIn > 0 && usdcIn > maxUsdcIn) revert MaxUsdcExceeded();


		uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified

		... skipped the code in the middle because is not relevant for the description of this issue
		
		// Calculate actual LP tokens received by comparing balances.
		uint256 newLpBalance = IERC20(SYMM_LP).balanceOf(address(this));
		lpAmount = newLpBalance - initialLpBalance;


		if (lpAmount < minLpAmountWithSlippage) revert SlippageExceeded();
	}
```

the `SymmVesting::getLiquidityQuote` is called to get the current live balances of the Balancer V3 pool:
[SymmVesting.sol#L247-L256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/vesting/SymmVesting.sol#L247-L256)
```solidity
	function getLiquidityQuote(uint256 symmAmount) public view returns (uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
		uint256[] memory balances = POOL.getCurrentLiveBalances();
		uint256 totalSupply = POOL.totalSupply();
		uint256 symmBalance = balances[0];
		uint256 usdcBalance = balances[1];
		
		usdcAmount = (symmAmount * usdcBalance) / symmBalance;
		usdcAmount = _mulDivUp(usdcAmount, 1e18, 1e30);
		lpAmount = (symmAmount * totalSupply) / symmBalance;
	}
```

This live balances can be modified in block due to an unintentional front-running.

This makes the default slippage check in `SymmVesting::_addLiquidity` rely on live data which can be manipulated unexpectedly:
```solidity
uint256 minLpAmountWithSlippage = minLpAmount > 0 ? minLpAmount : (expectedLpAmount * 99) / 100; // Default 1% slippage if not specified
```

As `expectedLpAmount` won't represent a an expected value, `minLpAmountWithSlippage` won't really be a slippage protection.

Note that **this isn't a user mistake** because the default slippage feature was designed by the protocol to work this way.

This will lead to loss of funds as in any common slippage issue.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User wants to add liquidity to the SYMM/USDC Balancer V3 pool, relying on the default slippage protection of 1% offered by the contract when no `minLpAmount` is specified.

### External Pre-conditions

- Unintentional front-running in Base private mempool.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Loss of user funds.
Considered Medium severity due to Sherlock's clarification on front-running on private mempools. See discussion [here](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/governance-and-discussion/discussions/22) or check Sherlock's documentation. Severity is High but has to be downgraded to Medium. 

### PoC

Not provided, known issue.

### Mitigation

- Rely on an external oracle to determine a 1% slippage protection. Check if price is accurate or not.
- Never rely on in-transaction calculations to work as slippage checks because they are easily manipulatable.
