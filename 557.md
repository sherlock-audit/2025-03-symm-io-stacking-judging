# Stale Timestamp Exploit in _updateRewardsStates

### Summary

When no tokens are staked, if `state.lastUpdated` is not refreshed, the elapsed time used in the reward calculation may be abnormally long. As soon as staking resumes, the contract will calculate rewards as if tokens were staked during that entire period, resulting in an inflated reward per token.
The severity is high as the vulnerability can lead to massive over-accrual of rewards, enabling attackers to drain the reward pool or dilute legitimate staker rewards

### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of an explicit update to `state.lastUpdated` when `totalSupply == 0` within the `_updateRewardsStates` function. The current implementation relies solely on:

     state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);

However, when no tokens are staked, `rewardPerToken` simply returns the existing `perTokenStored` without updating the timestamp. This leaves `state.lastUpdated` stale, causing the reward accrual calculation to consider a much longer elapsed time than intended once staking resumes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  Stale `state.lastUpdated`:
When `totalSupply == 0`, the function `rewardPerToken` returns the existing `perTokenStored` without updating `state.lastUpdated`. This leaves the timestamp unchanged even as time passes. 
2.  Lack of Timestamp Reset:
The `_updateRewardsStates` function does not include logic to set `state.lastUpdated` to `block.timestamp` when no tokens are staked, relying instead on `lastTimeRewardApplicable(token)` which, in this case, may not reflect a fresh start.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  Extended Periods of No Staking:
External market conditions or deliberate actions by stakers (or an attacker) may result in prolonged periods with `totalSupply == 0`. 
2.  Normal Operation:
When the contract is unpaused and operational, an attacker can trigger staking at any time to exploit the stale timestamp.


### Attack Path

1  Identification:
An attacker studies the reward accrual mechanism and identifies that when no tokens are staked, the contract does not refresh the `lastUpdated` timestamp. 
2 Preparation:
The attacker (or a colluding group) deliberately ensures that staking is halted (e.g., by withdrawing tokens) so that `totalSupply` becomes zero, leaving `state.lastUpdated` at an old timestamp. 
3  Exploitation:
After a significant period (Δt), the attacker or an accomplice stakes tokens. Due to the stale `lastUpdated`, the reward calculation uses an inflated Δt, resulting in excessive rewards accrued instantly. 
4  Outcome:
The attacker claims a disproportionate amount of reward tokens, diluting rewards for other users.


### Impact

Reward Over-Accrual:
When no tokens are staked, if `state.lastUpdated` is not refreshed, the elapsed time used in the reward calculation may be abnormally long. As soon as staking resumes, the contract will calculate rewards as if tokens were staked during that entire period, resulting in an inflated reward per token

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `_updateRewardsStates` function to explicitly update `state.lastUpdated` to block.timestamp when `totalSupply == 0`. For example, a suggestion would be:

     if (totalSupply == 0) {
         state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
     } else {
         state.lastUpdated = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);
     }
