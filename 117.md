# Attacker can easily disrupt reward distribution and render `SymmStaking` useless

### Summary

Due to the `notifyRewardAmount()` function being external and lacking access control, an attacker can dilute rewards exponentially, making the staking contract useless.

### Root Cause

The `notifyRewardAmount()` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L275-L292) in `SymmStaking` is permissionless. It allows anyone to add rewards to be distributed as yield. But if we look at the [follow-up logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L366-L379) that calculates the yield rate:

```solidity
	function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
@>			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

We can see that the rate will get divided by the duration again. What this means is any arbitrary attacker can notify rewards with 1 wei added as amount and repeatedly dilute the `reward.rate` variable over and over etc..

Attacker can do this a few times for each and every reward token if they wish to and completely mess up the rate at which rewards are distributed, heavily disrupting the contract and rendering it practically useless.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1 wei, multiple times

### Impact

Attacker can notify rewards with 1 wei and repeatedly dilute the reward.rate variable.

Attacker can do this a few times for each and every reward token if they wish to and completely mess up the rate at which rewards are distributed, heavily disrupting the contract and rendering it practically useless.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Probably a good idea to add access control so that only a specific ROLE within the protocol can notify new rewards.
