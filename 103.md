# Users could lose funds if transfer fails silently in Vesting.sol : _claimUnlockedToken and  _claimLockedToken

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L261

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/vesting/Vesting.sol#L281

in the `_claimLockedToken` and `_claimUnlockedToken ` the protocol uses `IERC20(token).transfer(user, claimableAmount); ` instead of safetransfer to transfer token to users 

Now some tokens like USDT can revert silently when this is done , and when revert silently these states will still be updated 
```solidity
totalVested[token] -= claimableAmount;  
    vestingPlan.claimedAmount += claimableAmount;  
  
```
  

### Root Cause

the protocol uses transfer to transfer funds to users instead of safeTransfer

### Internal Pre-conditions

when the protocol allows users to use tokens that can fail silently , tokens like USDT 

### External Pre-conditions

When users deposit tokens that can fail silently like usdc

### Attack Path

* users deposited  tokens that fails silently example usdt
* time to withdraw , users now call `_claimUnlockedToken` or otherwise
* now this fails silently , and the call to this function didnt revert 
* so state updates was updated successfully but user didnt receive funds 
  

### Impact

This will lead to users losing there locked and unlocked token 

### PoC

**Proof of Concept:**
* users deposited  tokens that fails silently example usdt
* time to withdraw , users now call `_claimUnlockedToken` or otherwise
* now this fails silently , and the call to this function didnt revert 
* so state updates was updated successfully but user didnt receive funds 
  

### Mitigation

Replace the .transfer with openzeppelin safeTransfer
