# Admin cannot disable reward tokens

 ### Root Cause

Admin can enable or disable a reward token but if there is pending reward,  rewards token wouldn't be disabled until pending reward becomes less than 10
```solidity
function configureRewardToken(address token, bool status) external onlyRole(REWARD_MANAGER_ROLE) {
		_updateRewardsStates(address(0));

		if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
		if (isRewardToken[token] == status) revert TokenWhitelistStatusUnchanged(token, status);

		isRewardToken[token] = status;
		if (!status) {
			@>>> if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
			uint256 len = rewardTokens.length;
			for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
				if (rewardTokens[i] == token) {
					rewardTokens[i] = rewardTokens[rewardTokens.length - 1];
					rewardTokens.pop();
					break;
				}
			}
		} else {
			rewardTokens.push(token);
			rewardState[token].duration = DEFAULT_REWARDS_DURATION;
		}

		emit UpdateWhitelist(token, status);
	}
```

and `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` can be called by everyone and malicious actor can use this function to revert disabling reward token's transaction

### Attack path

The protocol decides to disable a reward token and malicious actor becomes aware of that and he/she sends 1e18 token as reward tokens which is supposed to be disable as we can see admin cannot disable that reward until users claim full amounts of rewards which is sent by malicious actor

`SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` is pausable and if admin pauses `SymmStaking::notifyRewardAmount` to prevent this type of attack then all main functions will be paused also .hence , this isn't a good protection
