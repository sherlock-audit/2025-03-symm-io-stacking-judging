# Attacker will drain rewards from Legitimate stakers.



### Summary

The lack of a delay in SymmStaking.sol will cause a significant loss of rewards for legitimate stakers as an attacker will front-run the notifyRewardAmount transaction to inflate the totalSupply and claim a disproportionate share of the rewards."

### Root Cause

"In SymmStaking.sol lines 100-120, the notifyRewardAmount function immediately starts reward accrual based on the current totalSupply without any delay or lock period. This allows an attacker to deposit a large amount of SYMM tokens just before the reward notification, inflating the totalSupply and securing most of the rewards."

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.The totalSupply of staked SYMM tokens in SymmStaking needs to be relatively small (e.g., 1,000 SYMM) compared to the attacker’s potential deposit.

 2.The reward amount notified via notifyRewardAmount needs to be significant (e.g., 10,000 USDC) to incentivize the attack.

 3.The admin needs to call notifyRewardAmount without front-running protection (e.g., private mempool or off-chain coordination). 

### External Pre-conditions

1.SYMM liquidity on the Base network needs to be sufficient for the attacker to borrow a large amount of SYMM (e.g., 999,000 SYMM) via a flash loan.

2.The notifyRewardAmount transaction needs to be observable in the mempool or predictable (e.g., publicly scheduled).

### Attack Path

1.The attacker monitors the mempool for a pending notifyRewardAmount transaction from the admin.

2.The attacker calls deposit on SymmStaking with a large amount of SYMM tokens (e.g., 999,000 SYMM via a flash loan), increasing totalSupply from 1,000 to 1,000,000 SYMM.

3.The admin calls notifyRewardAmount, setting the reward rate based on the inflated totalSupply (1,000,000 SYMM).

 4.The attacker waits until the reward period ends (e.g., 1 week).

5.The attacker calls claimRewards to claim approximately 99.9% of the rewards (e.g., 9,990 USDC out of 10,000 USDC).

6.The attacker calls withdraw to retrieve their staked SYMM tokens and repays the flash loan

### Impact

The legitimate stakers suffer an approximate loss of 99.9% of their expected rewards. For example, with an initial totalSupply of 1,000 SYMM and 10,000 USDC in rewards, stakers would expect to share 10,000 USDC proportionally but receive only ~10 USDC (0.1%). The attacker gains 9,990 USDC from the stakers.

### Mitigation

To prevent this attack:

        1.Introduce a delay (e.g., 24 hours) between notifyRewardAmount and the start of reward accrual, giving legitimate stakers time to react.

        2.Implement a staking lock period (e.g., 1 day) where newly deposited tokens cannot claim rewards immediately, disincentivizing flash loan attacks.

        3.Use a commit-reveal scheme for reward notifications, where the admin commits to a reward amount privately and reveals it later, making front-running harder.
