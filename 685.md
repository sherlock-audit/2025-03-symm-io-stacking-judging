# Admin token rescue permanently locks reward token configurations

### Summary

The failure to update `pendingRewards` in `rescueTokens` will cause a permanent inability to remove reward tokens from the whitelist for admins as the contract will revert with `OngoingRewardPeriodForToken` when attempting to set `isRewardToken[token] = false` due to unadjusted pendingRewards exceeding 10 units after rescuing tokens.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343C2-L347C1

In SymmStaking.sol contract  the `rescueTokens` function transfers tokens out of the contract without updating the pendingRewards accounting system, creating a permanent discrepancy between actual token balances and internal accounting.
```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
    emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to have added a token to the whitelist by calling configureRewardToken(token, true)
2. Rewards must have been notified for this token, making pendingRewards[token] greater than 10
3. Admin needs to call rescueTokens() to withdraw some or all of the reward tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDT contract needs to allow] the transfer of at least 1000e6 USDT from the contract to the adminâ€™s address during the rescueTokens call.
2. No user claims via claimRewards] to reduce pendingRewards[USDT] from 1000e6 to below 10 before the admin attempts to configure the token.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls notifyRewardAmount([USDT], [1000e6]) to deposit 1000 USDT rewards, setting pendingRewards[USDT] = 1000e6 and contract balance to 1000e6 USDT.
2. Admin calls rescueTokens(USDT, 1000e6, adminAddress) to withdraw all USDT, reducing the contract balance to 0 USDT while pendingRewards[USDT] remains 1000e6.
3. Admin calls configureRewardToken(USDT, false) to remove USDT from the whitelist, but the check if (pendingRewards[USDT] > 10) (1000e6 > 10) triggers a revert with OngoingRewardPeriodForToken.
4. Without user claims to lower pendingRewards[USDT], the revert persists, blocking whitelist removal.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from permanent configuration lock for reward tokens. Once a token has been used for rewards, it cannot be removed from the whitelist, forcing the protocol to maintain support for potentially deprecated or unwanted tokens indefinitely. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove or adjust if `(pendingRewards[token] > 10)` to only apply when enabling a token, not disabling it, accepting the balance mismatch as a separate issue.
