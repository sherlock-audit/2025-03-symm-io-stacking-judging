# Precision loss in `rewardPerToken()` may lead to users losing rewards

## Summary: 

Function `_updateRewardsStates()` updates the `rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored` and the `lastUpdateTime` which will be used to calculate the rewards earned by stakers. 

However, during the calculation of `rewardPerTokenStored`, precision loss can occur.


## Description: 

In contract `SymmStaking`.
The calculations of this function is vulnerable to precision loss and may lead to users losing reward tokens.
[#rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/d7cf7fc96af1c25b53a7b500a98b411cd018c0d3/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L194-L202)

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {

if (totalSupply == 0) {
		return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /  totalSupply);
	}
```   

Even though the precision loss here is dust it becomes more serious if the reward token is with < 18 decimals and the staking token is with >= 18 decimals.

The worst case scenario would be if the newly calculated rewardPerToken rounds down to 0 which would result in `rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored` staying the same while the `rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime` gets updated, effectively losing users' rewards.

Consider the following scenario:


```solidity
_totalSupply = 100000e18
rewardAmount = 0.1 WBTC (1e7)
rewardsDuration = 2592000(30 days)
rewardRate = 1e7 / 2592000 = 3.85 (rounds down to 3, rest is stored in rewardResidual)
```


If `_updateRewardsStates()` is called after 10000 seconds and there currently are no rewards stored, the calculation of `rewardPerTokenStored`  will look like this:

` 10000 * 3 * 1e18 / 100000e18 = 0.3 (rounds down to 0) `

This means that the current stakers will not accumulate any rewards and the rewards that could not be accumulated due to this rounding issue will be stuck in the contract.

Since WBTC is a commonly used token, this scenario is not unrealistic. If `_updateRewardsStates()` is called every 10000 seconds (about 3 hours) until the end of the period, the whole 0.1 WBTC will be lost. This equals a loss of $10000.

As the documentation states that: 
`Only whitelisted tokens can work with the codebase, and these include stable-coins such as USDC, USDT, and USDE and Tokens like SYMM.`
Likely scenario can happen with tokens like USDC, USDT etc which will be used by the protocol as reward tokens. 

## Recommendation: 

The precision needs to be increased to ensure that no precision loss occurs and that the maximum loss a user can face when claiming their rewards is limited to 1 wei.
