# User can't claim other tokens' rewards if they are blacklisted by any single token

## Description
Both `claimRewards()` and `claimFor()` internally call [_claimRewardsFor()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L385) which loops through all the tokens and transfers any rewards for that specific token to the user:
```solidity
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
@-->	for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
				rewards[user][token] = 0;
				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
@-->			IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

This can result in:
1. Alice has some pending rewards in USDC and USDT.
2. Alice gets blacklisted by USDC before she can claim her rewards. 
3. If `claimRewards()` or `claimFor()` is called then `_claimRewardsFor()` loops through all tokens and attempts to `safeTransfer()` USDC reward amount to Alice. This reverts.
4. Alice doesn't get to receive her USDT rewards too now, which she rightfully is owed since she has not been blacklisted by USDT.

Note that even if admin calls `rescueTokens(address(USDT), usdtRewardAmount, address(alice))` now, the `pendingRewards[token]` mapping would not get updated.

## Impact
User can't claim their rewards.

## Mitigation 
There are two ways to handle this, either (or both) of which can be implemented:
1. Introduce `try-catch`:
```diff
	function _claimRewardsFor(address user) internal {
		uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
		for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
			address token = rewardTokens[i];
			uint256 reward = rewards[user][token];
			if (reward > 0) {
-				rewards[user][token] = 0;
-				pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
-				IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward);
-				emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
+               try IERC20(token).safeTransfer(user, reward) {
+                   rewards[user][token] = 0;
+                   pendingRewards[token] -= reward;
+                   emit RewardClaimed(user, token, reward);
+                } catch { emit RewardClaimFailed(user, token, reward); }
			}
			unchecked {
				++i;
			}
		}
	}
```

2. Introduce a `removeRewardsForUser()` function which can only be called by the admin:
```solidity
        function removeRewardsForUser(address token, uint256 amount, address user, address adminAddress) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
            pendingRewards[token] -= amount;
            rewards[user][token] -= amount;
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(adminAddress, amount);
        }
```
Now the admin can call `removeRewardsForUser(address(USDC), rewards[user][address(USDC)], user, adminAddress)` to reset user's USDC rewards to zero and transfer them to admin address at the same time.
