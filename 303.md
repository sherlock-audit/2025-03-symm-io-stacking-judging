# configureRewardToken() can get front-run and block a token's removal

## Description
We have inside `configureRewardToken()` the [following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L320) while removing a reward token:
```solidity
    if (pendingRewards[token] > 10) revert OngoingRewardPeriodForToken(token, pendingRewards[token]);
```

This can result in:
1. Admin calling `configureRewardToken(token, false)` to remove a reward token from the list.
2. It gets front-run by another tx of `notifyRewardAmount()` depositing `11 wei`. This increases `pendingRewards[token]` by `11`.
3. Now `configureRewardToken(token, false)` would revert.

Note that although on Base chain we have a private mempool and hence an attacker can't monitor it and front-run, the aforementioned sequence can still happen inadvertetnly. Also to be noted is that it's reasonable to assume that the protocol would inform it's users that a token is going to be retired and publish the dates for it and/or wait for pending rewards to be claimed. With this public knowledge, the probability increases that an attacker uses this attack path for griefing.

## Impact
Raising this as Med severity because although `configureRewardToken()` can revert, the protocol can distribute the attacker's donated tokens via `claimFor()` and continue.
It must be said though that adding `pendingRewards[token] -= amount` inside `rescueTokens()` functions would make the admin's task easier. Please refer the next section for a deatailed note.

## Mitigation 
- Firstly, `notifyRewardAmount()` should be made permissioned so that it can be called only by the admin.
- Secondly, we have a `rescueTokens()` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L343) which can be modified:
```diff
-       function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+       function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address receiver, bool updatePendingRewards) external nonReentrant onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
+           if (updatePendingRewards) pendingRewards[token] = pendingRewards[token] - (pendingRewards[token] > amount? amount : pendingRewards[token]);
            emit RescueToken(token, amount, receiver);
        }
```
Now the admin can first call `rescueTokens(address(USDC), blackListedUserPendingRewardAmount, rescueAddress, true)` and then proceed with `configureRewardToken(address(USDC), false)`.
