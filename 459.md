# Missing call to _disableInitializers in SymmStaking and  Vesting

### Summary

The SymmStaking and  Vesting contracts are using the Initializable module and doesnâ€™t have a constructor that calls _disableInitializers().

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers() function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-symm-io-stacking/blob/main/token/contracts/staking/SymmStaking.sol#L153

### Internal Pre-conditions

Proxy and implementation deploy

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

The attacke can call initialize  function in the implementation of SymmVesting or SymmVesting

### Impact

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider calling _disableInitializers()in the constructor.
