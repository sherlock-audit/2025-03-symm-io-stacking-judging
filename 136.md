# SymmStaking contracts have a loss of precision in the calculation of rewards.

## Summary

SymmStaking contracts have a loss of precision in the calculation of rewards, which may result in reduced or even zero rewards for the pledged user.

## Root Cause

```javascript
function _addRewardsForToken(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
		TokenRewardState storage state = rewardState[token];

		if (block.timestamp >= state.periodFinish) {
@>			state.rate = amount / state.duration;
		} else {
			uint256 remaining = state.periodFinish - block.timestamp;
			uint256 leftover = remaining * state.rate;
			state.rate = (amount + leftover) / state.duration;
		}

		state.lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
		state.periodFinish = block.timestamp + state.duration;
	}
```

```javascript
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256) {
		if (totalSupply == 0) {
			return rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored;
		}
		return
			rewardState[_rewardsToken].perTokenStored +
@>			(((lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken) - rewardState[_rewardsToken].lastUpdated) * rewardState[_rewardsToken].rate * 1e18) /
				totalSupply);
	}
```

Calculate state.rate in \_addRewardsForToken(), state.duration is one week, i.e. 604800 seconds, this division will cause precision loss.
Calculate perTokenStored in rewardPerToken(), although multiplied by 1e18, if the reward token is usdt, usdc and other tokens with a precision of 6, there may still be a loss of precision, resulting in a perTokenStored of zero.
Let's take 1000 usdc as an example, i.e. 1e9
(1) state.rate = 1e9 / 604800 = 1653
(2) totalSupply is assumed to be 1,000,000 SYMM Token, which is 1e24.
The last time lastUpdated was 10 minutes, i.e. 600 seconds.
Therefore perTokenStored = 600*1653* 1e18/ 1e24 = 0

This results in all users being rewarded 0, which is obviously not true.

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

(1) Reward tokens with lower precision such as usdt, usdc etc.
(2) Trigger the update of perTokenStored more frequently.

## Attack Path

An attacker can frequently go to deposit and withdraw 1 wei of SYMM.

## Impact

Users receive fewer rewards or even 0.

## PoC

## Mitigation

When calculating rate, multiply by a larger number to minimize loss of precision.
