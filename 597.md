# Forced Unlocked Token Claim When Claiming Locked Tokens

### Summary



In the vesting contract, the internal function to claim locked tokens is defined as follows:

```solidity
function _claimLockedToken(address token, address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    // First, claim any unlocked tokens.
    _claimUnlockedToken(token, user);
    VestingPlan storage vestingPlan = vestingPlans[token][user];
    if (vestingPlan.lockedAmount() < amount) revert InvalidAmount();

    // Adjust the vesting plan
    vestingPlan.resetAmount(vestingPlan.lockedAmount() - amount);
    totalVested[token] -= amount;
    uint256 penalty = (amount * lockedClaimPenalty) / 1e18;

    // Ensure sufficient balance (minting if necessary)
    _ensureSufficientBalance(token, amount);

    IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount - penalty);
    IERC20(token).transfer(lockedClaimPenaltyReceiver, penalty);

    emit LockedTokenClaimed(token, user, amount, penalty);
}
```

Notice that the first step in `_claimLockedToken` is an unconditional call to `_claimUnlockedToken`. This means that whenever a user (or operator) calls any function to claim locked tokens, the contract will automatically:

1. Compute the claimable (unlocked) amount for that user via the vesting plan.
2. Update the vesting plan state by increasing the `claimedAmount` and reducing `totalVested`.
3. Transfer the unlocked tokens to the user.

Only then does it proceed to process the locked tokens with the associated penalty.

###  Attack Vectors

1. **Unintended Claiming of Unlocked Tokens:**
   - **User Expectation:**  
     A user might intend to claim only their locked tokens (and incur the penalty) to benefit from an early unlock or to interact with liquidity mechanisms, while deliberately leaving unlocked tokens unclaimed (perhaps for timing, tax, or strategic reasons).
   - **Mismatch:**  
     Because the contract forces the claim of unlocked tokens first, the user loses control over when those tokens are claimed. The state is updated immediately, and the tokens are transferred—even if the user intended to keep them pending for a later time.
     
2. **Operator Abuse / Malicious Forcing:**
   - **Attack Scenario:**  
     An operator (or a malicious entity with the `OPERATOR_ROLE`) could trigger a locked token claim on behalf of a target user. Since the unlocked tokens are claimed automatically, this could force an unwanted change in the vesting plan state for that user. Repeated forced claims could disrupt the user’s planned vesting schedule or trigger adverse tax events.
     
3. **State Inconsistencies or Unexpected User Behavior:**
   - **User Interface Mismatch:**  
     If the front-end does not clearly communicate that claiming locked tokens will also process any pending unlocked tokens, users might be confused when their unlocked tokens are suddenly transferred, potentially affecting their liquidity planning or market strategies.

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. **Separate Claim Flows or Optional Claiming:**
   - **Separation:**  
     Consider decoupling the claim flows for unlocked and locked tokens. For example, allow the user to call a dedicated function for locked token claims that does not automatically claim unlocked tokens.
   - **Opt-in Parameter:**  
     Alternatively, include an explicit parameter in the locked token claim function (or in the user interface) that lets users decide whether to also claim unlocked tokens at that time.
